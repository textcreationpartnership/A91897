         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is not long ſince, that a Book of Mr. <hi>Robinſons,</hi> atteſted with Our Names, was publiſhed; the Subject whereof was this, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is All in All; wherein were opened thoſe Elegant Scripture Similitudes, by which, it pleaſed the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Holie Ghost, to illuſtrate unto us, the Perſon, Dignitie, and Offices of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: which Book, (as we are informed,) hath been verie acceptable to the People of God; eſpecially, of thoſe who ſtill retain the freſh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Mr. <hi>Robinſon's</hi> precious, and profitable Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:170411:4"/>
It were to be wiſhed, that thoſe Miniſters, who have leaſure, anſwerable to their great parts and abilities, would inrich the Church of God, with the fruits of their ſtudies and experiences, whilſt God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues them in this life: that ſo their Works might neither be neglected as poſthumous, nor ſuſpected as ſpurious.</p>
            <p>This little Treatiſe, now put into thy hands, thou mayſt be aſsured, is printed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Copy, left written by the <hi>Authours</hi> own hand.</p>
            <p>The ſubject here handled, is moſt Noble, <hi>viz.</hi> the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, who is the grand
<pb facs="tcp:170411:4"/>
Exemplar, and Perfect Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to all Chriſtians. Though we dare not ſay, that the onely or main end, either of Chriſts Life and Death, was to leave us an Example; yet we ſay, that one end thereof, was to leave us an Example, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. We do not, dare not, preſs the imitation of Chriſt upon that deſign that ſome have done, thereby, to enervate the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction &amp; propitiation by Chriſts death: For we do abhorre both thoſe opinions, <hi>viz.</hi> that the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> righteouſneſs, are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ours, then by imitation. But yet we ſay, that it concerns

all Chriſtians, ſo to improve the Example of Chriſts humilitie, meeknes, mercifulnes, obedience and zeal, that they ſhould walk, even as Chriſt hath walked. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 6. who hath not onlie left us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. <gap reason="foreign">

Each of theſe are urged by ſundry Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <p>So the Text is the amplification of one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, preſſing holneſs of life, in which we may obſerve two things.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. There are three things which muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to imitation, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There muſt be a performance of the ſame actions which are done by him, whom we imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. Identity of practiſe.</p>

               <p n="3">3. An endeavour to come as exactly as we can to the Copy: So now to imitate Chriſt, is,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To do the like actions which Chriſt did.</item>
                  <item>2. To do them out of a deſire to be like him.</item>

               <p n="2">2. Wherein we muſt imitate Chriſt. This is not unneceſſary, becauſe there are ſome actions of Chriſt, which are not imitable. There are three kind of actions which Chriſt did.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some things he did, <hi>quà Deus,</hi> his works of Divinity and Omnipotency: As his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous works of forgiving ſins, raiſing the dead, caſting out Devils, and curing Diſeaſes by his word, walking upon the Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis the pride of the Papiſts, to imitate Chriſt in theſe things, as their <hi>Quadrageſimal</hi> Faſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are for our admiration, not for our imitation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some things he did, <hi>quà Mediator,</hi> his works of office. As his Dying to reconcile God and man, offering up himſelf a Sacrifice for ſin. This is not for our imitation, only the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al of theſe is for us, That as Chriſt did, carefully, the works of his Calling, ſo ſhould we of our particular Calling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some things he did as he was made man, under the Law. And tehſe were of two ſorts:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170411:7"/>
Some in obedience to the Ceremonial Law, as he was the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the fleſh. As his ſubmitting to Circumciſion, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jewiſh Feaſts of Tabernacles, <hi>Pentecost,</hi> &amp;c. theſe we are not bound unto: Others, in obedience to the moral Law, thoſe moral acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt, the works of piety, of charity, which he did: his vertues as they are called, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. his humility, meekneſs, &amp;c. And therefore 'tis obſerved in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>Learn of me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: what? not to caſt out Devils, raiſe the dead, &amp;c. but learn meekneſs, lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the things which we are tyed toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate Chriſt in: The Reaſons why; theſe are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe Relations between Chriſt and a Chriſtian, call for it, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Maſter and Servant, this is a Relation of Imitation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 24, 25. 'tis there ſpoken, in regard of ſuffering: 'tis as forcible, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of doing. Our Saviour urgeth us in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe, upon this very ground, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 13, 14. Other Maſters cannot require imitation from their Servants in every thing, becauſe they miſlead, but Chriſt may.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That of Captain and Souldiers, that's a Relation of Imitation. <hi>Abimelech</hi> to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9. 49. <hi>Christ</hi> is our General and Captain, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That of Father and Children, Children ſhould imitate their Parents, not in every thing, many Parents would lead their Children to Hell, ſhould they follow them. The Apoſtle
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170411:8"/>
argues upon this ground this duty, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis one end of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Incarnation. There are in reference to man, two principal ends of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Incarnation; (for in reference to God, his main end was, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6.) One was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile God and man, by his obedience and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and ſo to bring in everlaſting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes. The other was, that he might ſet us an example for our Imitation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. that there might be found a perfect Pattern of grace and holineſs in our natures. Now unleſs we imitate his example, we ſhall, as much as lyeth in us, fruſtrate one end of his incarnation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis the higheſt pitch of ſpiritual perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 'Tis the duty of every Chriſtian, to grow up to as great a height as he can in grace and holineſs. Chriſtians are as Trees, which from a ſmall graff, grow up to a great ſtature, <hi>vid. Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> 'Tis a <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> of ſimi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itude, not of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Now the very top of this perfection, ſtands in this, that we be like <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a threefold likeneſs of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A likeneſs of nature, ſo we are all like him.</p>
               <p>A likeneſs of glory, that is reſerved for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, of which the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
               <p>A likeneſs of Grace, which conſiſts in the renewing of the mind, and in walking after this holy Pattern. This is the very Apex of that poor imperfect perfection which we can reach to here. <hi>Greg. Nyſſen</hi> defines Chriſtianity to be <hi>Imitationem Divinae Naturae. Qui plus habet</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:170411:8"/>
                  <hi>Chriſti, plus habet Chriſtianitatis,</hi> ſo doth the Apoſtle alſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is no other perfect Pattern to walk by, while we are in this World. All men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give us a bad example, or elſe an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect example. There are two things which make a perfect pattern,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it have exactneſs of every thing, which ſhould be required.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it have no blemiſh, or redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of any thing which ſhould not be. Now there is no ſuch Pattern, beſides <hi>Chriſts</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The Scripture indeed calls upon us, to follow the example of the Saints, the Apoſtle propounds his own example, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 17. but there are theſe limitations:</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt not imitate them in all things, becauſe they had graces in imperfection, and becauſe they had obliquities and deformities, as well as graces. That which is ſaid of Books, is as true as men in every thing elſe. <hi>Etiam in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timis Authoribus quaedam vitia. Moſes</hi> was not without his murmuring. <hi>David</hi> had his Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, <hi>Peter</hi> his denyal. Theſe are recorded to be as Shelfs of caution, not Copies of Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we muſt follow theſe only in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, and ſparks of piety.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt not follow the example of any one of them alone, becauſe there was in no one of them a compleat Pattern of all grace. God ſcattered his graces among the Saints; one was more eminent in one grace, a ſecond in another, <hi>&amp;c. Moſes</hi> for meekneſs, <hi>Job</hi> for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170411:9"/>
patience, <hi>Paul</hi> for contentment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This God did to preſerve the Communion of Saints, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in another caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. but now we may follow Chriſts example, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of theſe limitations, for there is in him,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A full concurrence of all graces com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, <hi>Cont.</hi> 5. 10, 11. <hi>ad finem. Col.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no obliquity in him. No ſpot, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 16. The Saints are like the Moon, the beſt of them have a dark ſide as well as a bright, <hi>who is ſhe that looketh as the Moon? Cant.</hi> 6. 10. Chriſt is as the Sun, which is all light, without the leaſt ſpot.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Saints are the Image of Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to walk as he walked. As the ſhadow followeth the ſubſtance, Chriſtians are (as it were) the ſhadow of Chriſt. And the goodneſs of all the actions and works which we perform, doth not ſtand in the ſubſtance of the work, but in relation and conformity to the Rule and Example, by which they are done.</p>
               <p>Information 1. That 'tis the duty of every <note place="margin">1. <hi>Uſe.</hi>
                  </note> Chriſtian, to know, and to be acquainted with the life of Chriſt: he that is ignorant of what Chriſt did, cannot poſſibly walk as he walked. What a ſad condition are they in, who having but one Copy to write after, are altogether without the knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What a great bleſſing it is, that God hath given unto us the Goſpel, and with what care
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170411:9"/>
and diligence, ſhould we bend our ſelves to the ſtudy of it; for Chriſts Example is to be found only there. <hi>In the volume of the Book it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of me,</hi> There are but three places where Chriſt is,</p>
               <p>In Heaven corporally;</p>
               <p>In the hearts of his people, by his Spirit;</p>
               <p>In the Goſpel, by his Example.</p>
               <p>The Goſpel is the Table, wherein the lively picture of Chriſt is, it reads us a Lecture of the life and death of Chriſt. Here are <hi>veſtigia Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti,</hi> you may ſee the prints of his feet here, here is the golden Sampler, its a rich Treaſure the Goſpel, <hi>vid. Col.</hi> 3. 16. not to ſojourn with us, but to dwell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What ſtrange Families that want Bibles, or having them read them not: what ſtrange work would Children make, had they no Sampler?</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is juſtification for a ſtrict and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect life. Many are ready to quarrel with the Servants of God for their preciſeneſs, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not run into the ſame exceſs of riot,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4. Profaneneſs is not ſo much quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel'd as Piety. Gods Servants dare not ſwear, dare not omit prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wicked men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them for it; but God commands it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 15. and Chriſts example calls for it. Chriſt never ſware, never ſpake idle word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He that reproaches them for their holineſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 11. ſo 'tis in this; he ſpeaks e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and judgeth <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

4. It ſhewes us, that many who live in the viſible Church, are far from true Chriſtianity, becauſe they have ſo little of <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon them, Swearers, Blaſphemers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, formall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our Saviour argues well with ſuch men, ſhewes them their Pedigree by their works, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 39. They claim <hi>Abraham</hi> for their Father, becauſe of their outward priviledges, Circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, v. 41. They claim God to be their Father: our Saviour, v. 44. tells them whoſe they are, or if <hi>Christs</hi> Example muſt be the Standard of true Chriſtianity; we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, <hi>Quam pauci, &amp;c.</hi> Many hate his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, many only talk of it, many follow it in one kind only, few take up his whole Example, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </gap>: In all his actions and carriages, he expreſſed very great humility.</p>

                  <item>3. I ſhall apply the point.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Sundry things teſtifie his humility, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. His avoiding and declining earthly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, upon all occaſions. 'Tis a ſign of a humble heart, to contemn and reject worldly honours, and promotions. A man may perhaps, ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decline ſuch advancement, either out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be accounted humble, or that more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity may be urged to prevail with them for acceptance, or out of a Complement, or to avoid trouble and charge, or becauſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titeneſs as <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 22. A man of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may take the loweſt place, and decline to ſit in the higheſt Seat, that it may with more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity be conferred upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viſne Epiſcopari? Nolo,</hi> that Anſwer was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Biſhop, he muſt modeſtly ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unwilling, though he had uſed both Cap and Purſe to get the Chair. But Jeſus Chriſt did really avoid all earthly dignity, and that out of humility of ſpirit, <hi>vid, Joh.</hi> 6. 15. he ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170411:13"/>
for fear of a Crown; not as <hi>Saul,</hi> becauſe of the care and the trouble, but meerly out of a contempt of outward greatneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His concealing and ſuppreſſing his own prayſes. Proud perſons will be alwayes ſtroak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own heads, and trumpetting out their own prayſes; but humility will caſt a vail over that goodneſs and glory which is in it ſelf, <hi>vid. Prov.</hi> 20. 6. and thus did the Phariſees, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 15. our Saviour he kept-under the glory of his own miracles;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes by doing them in ſecret, <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 37. Pride loves to act upon an open Stage, in the face of many ſpectators, it would <hi>be ſeen of men;</hi> but humility acts under Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes by charging thoſe who were beholders and partakers of them, not to make him known, as <hi>Math.</hi> 17. 9. concerning the viſion at his transfiguration, <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 43. when he reſtored to life, the Daughter of the Ruler of the Synagogue, and <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 36. when he gave ſpeech to the dumb man; and ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 14. to the Leper. His diſciples we find, did earneſtly ſollicit him to ſet up his Bills (as it were) and to practiſe his mighty works openly, <hi>John</hi> 7. 4. And yet he declined it, yea, we find, that he rather choſe to be in the Deſert, when his miracles were noyſed abroad, than in the Cities, as <hi>Luc.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
               <p>Sometimes indeed, he commanded his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to be made known, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 39. that his <hi>Father might be glorified in the World,</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170411:13"/>
that there might be an acceſſion of people to himſelf, to receive his Doctrine, and believe in him; but we finde, that for the moſt part he concealed them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He mixed and joyned himſelf to perſons of the pooreſt and meaneſt condition: he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver declined converſe with any, either becauſe of their low parts, or mean condition. Proud perſons will not keep company with beggars, and ragged perſons; they keep at a diſtance, and ſhun their Company, though perhaps nearly realted to them: many a proud Child, when once rich, forgets his Parents, or neareſt friends. Jeſus Chriſt did otherwiſe, he converſed freely with the poor Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> who came with her Pitcher to draw water as freely as if ſhe had been a royal perſon, <hi>John</hi> 4. His Diſciples we finde, wondred at it, when they ſaw their Maſter diſcourſing with a Woman, as thinking it too low for him, <hi>John</hi> 4. 27. their ſpirits were a little higher than their Maſters. A poor blinde beggar at the high-way ſide, calls to him, he ſtraight commands him to be brought, and diſcourſes with him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 40. yea, not only with mean perſons, but many times with lewd and vicious perſons, ſuch as the Publicans and ſinners were, when he might do them any good: Though his credit with men was blaſted for his condeſcenſion that way, called <hi>a friend of Publicans,</hi> yet for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, he regards not that. He even made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>equal with them of low degree,</hi> Rom. 12. 6. yea, he did not ſcorn to have, even Children
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170411:14"/>
brought to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. his Diſciples they find fault with it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. as thinking it too far below the dignity of his perſon, to have any thing to do with them, but Chriſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He was ready and willing to do the meaneſt Offices for men, he takes water, and waſhes his Diſciples feet, <hi>John</hi> 13. 5. as though he had been their Servant, and not their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, he was ready to go at every ones call, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 7. <hi>I will come and heal him,</hi> though it was but a Servant.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He did bear with the weakneſs and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Diſciples, in many things, without ſcorn or deriſion. We are exhorted to this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1, 2. When he preached to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, concerning the Parable of the <hi>Tares,</hi> they come to him, and he interprets without upbraiding them. They dreamed of an earthly Kingdom, though Chriſt had often told them, that his <hi>Kingdom was not of this World,</hi> yet he humbly informs them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He lived meanly in the World, did not chuſe Kings, but mean perſons for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; was contented to lie hard, and fare hard; was of a mean Trade and employment in the World, till he took him upon the work of the Miniſtry, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 3. If you trace him from the beginning of the Goſpel to the end, you will <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 8, 9.</note> find his humility.</p>
               <p n="7">7. His miſerable and curſed Death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7, 8. his patient ſufferings from meaneſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:170411:14"/>
Second thing, Why Chriſt was thus humble? Not becauſe he had nothing in him, though he had all things in him, which might have height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his heart.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7. he was high born, <hi>the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) He had high Offices, <hi>King, Prophet, Prieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) He was rich, <hi>Heir of all things,</hi> Heb. 1. 2. greater than <hi>Solomon,</hi> Mat. 12. 42.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) He had all excellent parts; he was wiſe, He was beautiful, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 3. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. He was full of grace, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. He had Angels his Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">(5) He was appiauded by many: yet was he lowly in heart: which will appear by ſeven particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was ſuitable to his condition, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken <hi>upon him the form of a Servant,</hi> by taking our Nature upon him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. it was meet, that he ſhould be humble. <hi>He came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter,</hi> Mat. 20. 28. He was <hi>in ſtatu humiliationis,</hi> as he ſtood in our ſtead, and it was neceſſary, that his carriage ſhould be ſuitable to his ſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was full of every grace, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. He was full of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To teach his Diſciples, both the twelve <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21.</note> that followed him in the fleſh, and all others after them, how they ſhould carry themſelves in the World, <hi>John</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Third thing, is the Uſe. I will only make one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:170411:15"/>
That we would all endeavour to walk as Chriſt walked, in this regard. We live in a proud age: Chriſtians were never ſwollen big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, either with corporal, or ſpiritual pride, than now they are, as though they were not Diſciples of Chriſt, but Diſciples of Lucifer. Hardly is there a fooliſh gariſh faſhion in the World, but its taken up, if not invented by Profeſſors of Religion. The Apoſtle would not have Chriſtians <hi>to be conformed unto the World,</hi> Rom. 12. 2. but moſt Chriſtians ſtudy nothing more than this comformity. This flag of pride is not diſplayed any where larger then in the houſes and hearts of thoſe who would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted moſt eminent in Chriſtianity. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch a generation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 13. if ever ſuch a Generation lived upon Earth, it lives in the preſent age.</p>
               <p>The Servants of Chriſt in former ages walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in another poſture, they were little in their own eyes. See what <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lord, I am but duſt and aſhes,</hi> Gen. 18. 27. God calls him the great man, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 2. See what <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. <hi>I am leſſe, &amp;c.</hi> See what <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaph</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 22. <hi>I am even as a Beaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee.</hi> Wiſe <hi>Agur,</hi> what he ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 10. See what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am leſſe then the leaſt of all the Apoſtles, I am as one born out of due time,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 8, 9. And in another place, <hi>leſſe then the leaſt of all Saints,</hi> Epheſ. 3. verſ. 8. In another place, <hi>The chiefeſt of ſinners;</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18. The Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. <hi>Lord, be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:170411:15"/>
But what is the Language of Chriſtians now? juſt like that in <hi>Eſay</hi> 65. 5. <hi>Stand by thy ſelf, come not near me, I am holier then thou.</hi> We may ſay as he did, when he read the Goſpel, <hi>Aut hoc non eſt Evangelium, aut nos non ſumus Evangelici.</hi> The Apoſtle foretells of the ſins of the laſt days, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. Pride and high-mindedneſs are two of thoſe ſins. Surely that Propheſie is calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the meridian of our time. They are the two ſins of our age, what elſe meanes the blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Why elſe comes it to paſſe, that there is ſuch diſtance amongſt the people of God? why ſuch with-drawings one from another? Too much pride, and too little love, is the cauſe of Schiſme. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Only by pride, comes contention,</hi> Prov. 13. 10. If contention be the child of pride, ſurely we are guilty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why are Chriſtians of low parts ſo much deſpiſed? Is it not for want of humility? <hi>vid. Phil.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why elſe do men thruſt themſelves from their private Callings, into the Miniſtery? Is it not becauſe of pride? They think too well of themſelves certainly, <hi>vid.</hi> Pſal. 131. 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why do men ſleight the plain wholſom truths of God?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Why will not men come under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt? 'Tis for want of lowlineſs of heart. Our Saviour hints it in this Text, where he puts lowlineſs of heart, and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his yoak, together; other things are pretended, but pride is at the root.</p>

               <p>Pride of heart doth beget many ſins, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It will not patiently ſuffer the word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, neither private from Chriſtian friends, nor open rebuke from the publick Miniſtry. Pride will not bear reproof, but will rage at it. Its a great mercy to be reproved and rebuked for ſin, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rebuke an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. Lev.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Pearles Matth.</hi> 7. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>David</hi> prayes for it, <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be as precious balm,</hi> Pſal. 141. 5. But Pride in the heart will make the ſpirit fret and riſe againſt home-reproofs, and againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover alſo, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 29. 21. Reproofs are <hi>veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates mordaces,</hi> and a proud heart cannot bear
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170411:16"/>
them. Proud <hi>Ahab</hi> cannot bear the reproofs of <hi>Micajah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 8. Proud <hi>Amaziah</hi> ſtorms at the rebukes of <hi>Amos,</hi> the Land is not able to bear his words, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 10. The proud men were they who raged at the reproof of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Cap. 43. 2. A humble heart lies open to rebukes for ſin, will pray for them, and bleſs God when it comes home to his Conſcience, <hi>&amp;c. Prov.</hi> 9. 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Pride of heart, it will incline them to envy the graces of God in other men. A proud perſon hates and malignes every one who out-ſtrips and out-ſhines himſelf: he cannot bear either an equal or ſuperior. Its a duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in, and to bleſſe God for, the excellent gifts and graces of other men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> did well: <hi>Would all the Lords People were Prophets,</hi> Numb. 11. 29. <hi>Joſhua</hi> he is a little troubled at it, <hi>Moſes</hi> rejoyceth: high-minded men are very apt to ſleight, and grieve, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at other mens eminency, which is a very great ſin. A proud man is glad to ſee others e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed, that he may ſhine the clearer. Yea, its his ingeny and diſpoſition, to be blotting and diſparaging others, to make himſelf the more glorious. Now what a fearful ſin is this, to hate and deſpiſe men for their goodneſs!</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will incline a man to be glad at the ſins and ſlips, and miſcarriages of others. Its a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great ſin to rejoyce in iniquity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 6. 'Tis a very diabolical thing to be delighted to ſee others fall into ſin, or into miſery. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:170411:17"/>
'Tis Satans great work and deſign. Now he that is proud in heart, is eaſily tempted to this ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It inclines a man to ſleight and contemn all other men, and to think very meanly of them, <hi>vid.</hi> Phil. 2, 3. there is a duty laid down, <hi>To esteem others better then our ſelves,</hi> and there is the way to attain unto it, <hi>viz.</hi> lowlineſs of minde. <hi>Vid. Luk.</hi> 18. 11. proud Phariſee.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Pride keeps a man from ſeeing or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his own ſins, errors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, it will put a man upon the maintaining of them: it hinders a man from retreating, or retracting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evil which he hath done. Humility will make a man acknowledge what is amiſſe in himſelf, and recede from it preſently. Pride keeps off conviction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> would have retracted his Doctrine of conſubſtantiation, but he was afraid all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrines would have been called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. There was a little want of humility. Had <hi>David</hi> been proud, when <hi>Nathan</hi> told him, thou art the man, he had not confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Pride of heart will make a man content to arrogate to himſelf, or to have others aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to him, that which is not indeed in him. <hi>It is the voyce of a God, and not of a man.</hi> Proud <hi>Herod</hi> will ſwallow and digeſt that flattery from the people, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 22, 23. 'Tis a great ſin for a man to think of himſelf better then he is, or to deſire that others ſhould do ſo. 'Tis a ſin for a man to think <hi>himſelf ſomething, when</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:170411:17"/>
                  <hi>he is nothing. Magus. Acts</hi> 8. 9.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It will hinder a man from doing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming thoſe duties he owes to others, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Superiors, Equals, or Inferiors. He will not honour his ſuperiors, not condeſcend to do thoſe offices to inferiors, which he ought. Should I ſtoop to ſuch a one as he is? ſo mean, ſo poor?</p>
               <p>He will not make himſelf <hi>equal to men of low degree,</hi> Rom. 12. 6. In giving honours prevent one another.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He will not bear the leaſt indignity, or injury from another, but will revenge himſelf. Should I put up ſuch a wrong from ſuch a mean hand? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will make him know who I am, <hi>vid. Col.</hi> 3. 12, 13. No forbearing one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, if there be not humbleneſs of mind. <hi>Haman</hi> will deſtroy <hi>Mordecai,</hi> if he give not Cap and knee.</p>
               <p n="9">9. He will never be ſo thankful as he ought, for mercies received, either from God or man: A proud perſon judgeth all of debt, which comes in, either from God or man. Low thoughts of our ſelves, is that which makes us thankful for mercies. Lord, what am I, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18. this made him thankful, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 4, 5. <hi>Lord, what is man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. It makes men contentious, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 10. Its ill living by a proud man.</p>
               <p n="11">11. It will create diſcontent and riſings of heart againſt Gods hand upon him. Humility
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170411:18"/>
makes the heart quiet, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 10. Pride thinks all croſſe providences injurious, &amp; therefore frets and rageth, <hi>Pauls</hi> humility learned him contentment. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>It brings upon men much anger, many judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Pride hath trouble.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God hates them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God reſiſts and fights againſt the proud perſon, <hi>vid.</hi> Jam. 4. 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. God hath determined, <hi>that every knee ſhall bow unto him,</hi> Iſa. 45. 23. that all things and perſons ſhould be level'd and laid flat, that he alone may be exalted. Now the proud perſon will not ſtoop, therefore God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make warre with him, to ſet himſelf in battle array, to bring his Armies againſt him, to conſtrain him to ſubjection; as the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doth break in pieces that which reſiſts, ſo doth God. <hi>Vid.</hi> Eſa. 2. 12, 13, &amp; 11. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Explication.</hi> This is a ſad judgement, to have God an adverſary. <hi>Vid.</hi> Prov. 5. 25. God overthroweth the houſe of the proud. All men are enemies to the proud man: <hi>His hand is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every man, and every mans hand against him.</hi> Though all Creatures reſiſted him, yet if God take his part, his condition were ſafe; but God is more againſt him then man. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts his perſon, and God reſiſts his ſervices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Pride is the ready way to blaſt all your excellencies. It either removes, or brings a <note place="margin">Abſalom proud of his hair.</note> Cloud upon every precious thing which God hath given you. There is but a few ſteps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170411:18"/>
pride and deſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 18. It is <note place="margin">Many have loſt their wits and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories by pride. God ſtrikes men, in that which they ſet higheſt, uſually.</note> the grave of every thing which is precious, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. 24. To be proud of beauty, of parts, of graces, is the way to loſe them, <hi>&amp;c. Vid.</hi> Ezek. 16. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. ſee her ſin, verſ. 15. Pride, this ſtript her of all. God hath reſolved <hi>to ſtain, and marre the pride of all glory,</hi> Iſa. 23. 9. Pride will moath-eat your Garments, and ruſt all your brightneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Pride, it is <hi>venenum omnium virtutum &amp; recte factorum.</hi> It deprives a man of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and comfort of every good thing which he doth or hath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Magis placet Deo humilitas in malis factis, quàm ſuperbia in bonis.</hi> God would rather have <hi>Paul</hi> to be buffetted with Satan, than to be proud of his viſions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. He that is humbled after an act of prophaneneſs, is better then he that is proud of an act of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As our Saviour ſaith of the Hypocrite, <hi>He hath his reward,</hi> Matth. 6. 5, 6. his oſtentation and pride, bereaves him of the wages he might have of his work. A Servant that is humble, though he do not his work ſo well, is better than he that is excellent at working, and puffed up with pride. <hi>Vid. Luk.</hi> 18. the proud Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, and lowly Publican. <hi>Vid.</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> prefers humility in a low condition before pride, in a higher condition. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 19.</p>
               <p>2d Motive, From the excellency of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its an excellent grace in it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:170411:19"/>
2. Precious Promiſes are made to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In it ſelf its very excellent. It is a very choice part of the Image of Chriſt. Pride and ſelf-admiring is the chief part of the Image of Satan. <hi>Initium Peccati, ſuperbia:</hi> the Devils ſin was pride, he would be equal to God, <hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods,</hi> Gen. 3. 5. <hi>Diabolus ſuperbus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem ſuperbientem produxit ad mortem.</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is Chriſts Image, <hi>I am lowly in heart.</hi> It is the Ornament of all other parts and graces, its the varniſh of graces, and the beauty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. A humble Chriſtian is a lovely Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Pride brings contempt upon rich parts, humility caſts glory upon them. It is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver and keeper of all other excellencies in a man, its the baſis which upholds all. A buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſet upon a good bottom, will ſtand, when high Turrets which ſtand upon Sand will fall. The Devils pride deſtroyed all his excellency: had they been humble, they had ſaved all, as well as the other Angels. Humility is the lock and key of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Humility is the firſt, ſecond, and third grace, as he ſaid of elocution in Rhetorick. Its love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Men, to God. It makes a man do any thing, bear any thing. It makes men fear Gods frowns, <hi>&amp;c. Mich.</hi> 6. 8. It will carry a man through ſcorns, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 22. 'Tis the <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum postulatum</hi> of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath made many excellent promiſes to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>he will teach them,</hi> Pſal. 25.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:170411:19"/>
9. Humility is one neceſſary qualification for inſtruction. Proud men ſcorn to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The Philoſophers Scholar muſt be <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milis.</hi> Its a great happineſs when God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to teach a man, he hath skill, and he hath ability, he can give men a heart to learn, <hi>Vid. Iſa.</hi> 54. 13. The reaſon why men learn no more by God word, by his works, is, becauſe God doth not teach them, and God refuſeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, becauſe they are ſo proud. Men will not inſtruct proud perſons, no more will God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath promiſed to hear their cryes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>He forgetteth not the cry of the humble.</hi> Proud beggars are uſually anſwered with ſcorn and denyal, ſo are proud Chriſtians. Proud perſon will not receive Commands from <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> will not receive Petitions from them. 'Tis a certain Rule, God will receive prayers from none who will not receive Commands &amp; Precepts from him. 'Tis a ſingular favour, to have our prayers granted, and a diſcouraging thing to have our ſuits rejected: what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints the people of God have made, when they have been refuſed, <hi>vid. Lam.</hi> 3. <hi>init.</hi> and many ſad complaints in the Pſalms to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and much gladneſs of heart, doth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of our Petitions, create in our hearts, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 20.</note> in the ſaddeſt troubles. Humility prepares Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Pride puts a barre in the way; faſting and prayer are found together, faſting notes Humility.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:170411:20"/>
3. God hath promiſed <hi>to reſpect them, and to dwell with them. Vid. Pſal.</hi> 138. 6. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 2. God deſpiſes the proud, and <hi>looks upon them afar off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They look upon all others at a diſtance, and ſo God looks upon them, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 17. <hi>Gregory</hi> upon thoſe words, <hi>Magnus mihi fuisti quia deſpectus tibi; at nunc quia magnus tibi es mihi deſpectus es.</hi> 'Tis a ſingular happineſs to have reſpect and good looks from God, to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. This is our Heaven upon Earth. This the Servants of God have beg'd, and mourned for the want of it. Humility drawes Gods eye.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God promiſeth to fill them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> calls Humility <hi>Vacuum Spirituale.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ayr will deſcend, water aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to prevent a</hi> Vacuum.</note> Now Nature admits no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> but fills it preſently. God will not ſuffer the humble heart to be unfilled, <hi>vid. Luk.</hi> 1. 52. The rain which falls upon the Mountains, falls down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Vallies. Your Vallies and low grounds have the richeſt crops; your humble Chriſtians have fulleſt ſouls, high Mounts are barren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3d. <hi>Motive.</hi> In Nature we ſee humility; your fulleſt ear hangs loweſt, and your fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt boughes. Slicker eares ſtand higheſt <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>A Medicine of theſe ſeven Ingredients.</hi>

               <p>2d Meditation of our baſe condition by ſin.

of the multitudes of his Diſciples. <hi>He went up into a Mountain apart to pray.</hi>

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:170411:23"/>
2. Why he prayed private<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Christ did not pray in regard of want, as we do,</hi> we are alwayes wanting ſomething, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have conſtant need of prayer, but our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour wanted nothing, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. all fulneſs was in him, fulneſs for himſelf, and fulneſs for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; fulneſs of the Veſſel, and fulneſs of the Fountain. <hi>He indeed took our nature upon him,</hi> and ſo our wants. He did not pray, becauſe he wanted; but becauſe he would pray, therefore he would want.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ prayed in reference unto precept and command</hi> Prayer is a duty enjoyned of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Chriſtians. Its a ſpecial piece of Gods worſhip. Its an Act of Adoration. Prayer gives unto God the glory of many of his Attributes, <hi>viz.</hi> of his wiſdom, Power, Providence, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience. And if we ſhould be under no wants, yet we ſhould pray. Its our ſin, that we look more at neceſſity, then at duty. Now in this reſpect Chriſt prayed. He being made man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, it was neceſſary, that he ſhould ſtoop to every command thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt prayed to honour prayer.</hi> Prayer is a very great priviledge, as well as a duty. Though there were neither neceſſity to move us, nor command to enforce us, yet the very dignity and Prerogative were enough, that duſt and aſhes ſhould be admitted into ſuch familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and converſe with God, this is a great advancement. Jeſus Chriſt he honoured prayer by performing it, but we are exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured by prayer. Chriſt therefore, to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170411:23"/>
preach up the worth of this duty, was ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in it, to make us in love with it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt was, Os Eccleſiae,</hi> the Mediator of the Church, our interceſſor and high Prieſt, <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go;</hi> prayer was a very principal part of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorious office and work. He was no leſſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, when he lay praying in the Garden, than when he hung upon the croſſe of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. There are two parts of Chriſts Prieſtly Office; Satisfaction, Interceſſion. He began his Interceſſion on earth, he continues it ſtill in Heaven. There is great difference between his prayer in Heaven, and his prayer on Earth. That is only the prayer of interceſſion, this was alſo the prayer of ſupplication, <hi>vid.</hi> John 17. <hi>I pray for them whom thou haſt given me out of the World, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Chriſt prayed for our Imitation, ut Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter noſter,</hi> that he might teach us to pray. <hi>Audis Chriſtum orantem?</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin, Diſce orare, Ideo Chriſtus oravit, ut doceret te crare.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of his ſufferings, that they were for our imitation, <hi>leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. Hereupon, one well deſcants upon this; <hi>Orat miſerecordia? Tacet miſeria? Orat innocentia? ſilet impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas? Orat is qui non fecit peccatum? ſilet pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? Orat medicus? ceſſat agrotus? Orat Judex ut parcat? &amp; ſilet reus?</hi> The Phyſician prayes, to teach the Patient his duty: the Judge prayes, that he may excite the guilty and condemned ſinner, to do his duty. Mercy is upon her knees, to teach miſery to bow.<hi>—Vid. Luk.</hi> 11. 1.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:170411:24"/>
6. <hi>Chriſt prayed, to ſanctifie his other perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,</hi> his preaching, his miracles. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our knew well, that its prayer which renders other things efficacious. Hence it is, that we finde prayer following his preaching, and his miracles. His preaching, ſo it is in <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Vid.</hi> verſ. 1. it was after his preaching, and ſo after his miracles; ſo in the Text, he had wrought a great work in the ſight of the people, and afterward he betakes himſelf to prayer. Our Saviour would not have, either his Sermons, or miracles to fall to the ground, <hi>ergo,</hi> he prayes, when he ordained his Diſciples, and ſent them abroad to preach the Goſpel, he ſpends a whole night in prayer beforehand, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 12. Our Saviour was much in publick works, <hi>Ergo,</hi> frequent in prayer. <hi>Every Creature of God is ſanctified by the word and prayer,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Chriſtians miſcarry in other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances ordinarily for want of this duty. The Seed ſowen, doth not proſper for want of the watring of prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Why Chriſt uſed private prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Obedience to divine Command.</hi> God hath enjoyned Chriſtians, not only the publick, but the private alſo. <hi>Families apart, and their Wives apart,</hi> Zech. 12. 12, 13. Cloſer-prayer is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as well as Church-prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Enter into thy Cloſet.</hi> As this made him pray, ſo it made him to pray privately, to honour pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt goes apart to pray, that he might not be obſerved.</hi> He hath given others a Rule, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170411:24"/>
he walks by it himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. Our Saviour did earneſtly deſpiſe and decline vain glory. He did many miracles in private, that they might not be known, and he prayes in private, that he might not be ſeen of men, that he might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all oſtentation, and ſhews of popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That he might not be interrupted in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Our Saviour would not be diſturbed in prayer, therefore he go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s apart: ſecreſie is an advantage, in regard of diſtraction.</p>
               <p>It is granted, that our Saviour could prevent diſtractions, when he was in the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people. As he was never ſimply <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, becauſe the Father was with him;</hi> ſo neither was he ſimply in Company: but becauſe men are not able to avoid diſturbance, when they are with others, therefore he ſets them the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>To ſet us an Example, that we ſhould not content our ſelves with publick prayers only,</hi> but ſhould alſo be employed in the private alſo.</p>
               <p>Uſe of this point, is threefold.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>(1) Conſolation.</item>
                  <item>(2) Inſtruction.</item>
                  <item>(3) Exhortation.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Its great comfort to a Chriſtian, that Chriſt prayed ſo much.</hi> All his prayers, both publick and private, are for our conſolation. He prayed not ſo much for himſelf, as for us. The Incoms of his prayers are exceeding precious, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to Chriſtians: we reap the benefit of his prayers on earth to this day, and ſo ſhall
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170411:25"/>
all the ſervants of God to the end of the World. Some of his prayers are recorded thoſe are full of comfort, as that in <hi>John</hi> 17. how much is there in that prayer: others are only generally related, the duty is mentioned, the words are not mentioned. Its a comfort to us.</p>
               <p n="2">1. When we go to pray, that our prayers ſhall be welcom to him. He that prayed ſo much on Earth for us, will gladly accept our Petitions, when they are preferred; and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his work now in Heaven is to preſent our prayers to the Father. <hi>We may come boldly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Throne of Grace,</hi> Heb. 4. 16. <hi>He lives for ever to make interceſſion</hi> Heb. 7. 25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It comforts us in the aſſurance of being taught, and inſtructed by him how to pray.</hi> He that was ſo oft ſpeaking to God for us on Earth, will not deny his ſpirit of prayer and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, <hi>when we ask it;</hi> and this the rather we may be perſwaded of, becauſe of his word of promiſe, that is gone out of his mouth. He that is the ſpirit of prayer, is the ſpirit of the Son. <hi>God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts,</hi> Gal. 4. 6. <hi>He taught his Diſciples to pray,</hi> Luk. 11. 1, 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>When we are interrupted, and taken off by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hand of God from this duty of prayer;</hi> if ſickneſs, weakneſs, be upon us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tis our comfort, that Chriſt was ſo frequent in this work for us: the vertue of his prayers are in force to this very day. Tis a comfort, when we are hindred in prayer, that the Saints are a praying for us, not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170411:25"/>
the Saints in Heaven, <hi>Abraham is ignorant of us,</hi> Iſa. 63. 16. How much more, that we have ſo many prayers of Chriſt on the file for us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Againſt the infirmity of our prayers, its a ground of comfort, our prayers are much ſoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, many deformities are upon them, but all the prayers Chriſt put up were pure and holy: ours are ſmoak, Chriſts were pure incenſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When we are in trouble, when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are roſſed on the Sea, Chriſt is a praying in the Text.</p>
               <p>2d <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> Inſtruction: teacheth, that Jeſus Chriſt was a very faithfull Mediator and High-Prieſt. He was careful of both parts of his Prieſtly Office, not only of ſatisfaction, but of Interceſſion alſo. He was the Churches Spokeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and he performed it faithfully for them. Not a day paſſed over his head, in which he did not make mention of his Church unto God by prayer. He did conſtantly poure out teares, breath out ſighs and prayers for them. There was not the leaſt piece of his Office in any kind, but he faithfully performed it.</p>
               <p>3d <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Exhortation. <hi>He that ſaith he abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in Chriſt, ought himſelf ſo to walk, as Chriſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 6</note> 
                  <hi>walked.</hi> Let us imitate his example in the duty of private prayer. I fear this duty is much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by Chriſtians in our dayes. I fear the publick ſwallows up the private. Shall our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter pray in private, and ſhall we neglect it? It is not enough, that you pray in your Families with others, or that you pray in the Church with the Congregation. Chriſt did this, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170411:26"/>
yet he had his private prayers beſides. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, they have been careful of this. <hi>Peter,</hi> he <hi>goes to the houſe-top to prayer,</hi> Acts 10. 9. <hi>Daniel</hi> he had his cloſet-prayers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10. it had been his manner, ſo to do. So had <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 119. 164. <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 24. 63. <hi>Jonah</hi> he had his private prayer, <hi>in the belly of the Whale.</hi> Chap. 2. 1. and generally, all the Saints, Maſters, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Servants, Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> every one apart, <hi>Vid.</hi> Zech. 12. 12, 13. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. 'tis en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. Governours of Families muſt do it themſelves, and perſwade and call upon their Children and Servants to do it, particularly, morning and evening.</p>
               <p>I would urge this by ſome Motives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 1. <hi>The advantage of this ſecret prayer</hi> would be conſidered, beſides all the benefits of Prayer in general, ſecret prayer hath theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſoul hath more freedom and liberty than it hath in the publick;</hi> many ſins are to be confeſſed, which cannot ſo well and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be done in the publick.</p>
               <p>It is not ſo convenient, not is there ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ripping up the particular ſecret ſins of the ſoul in publick, but the Cloſet gives us conveniency to unbare all, even the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins. The ſoul may without ſhame or fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> diſcover all. And ſo for the wants for ſoul and body, they may more particularly and with greater freedom, be repreſented to the Lord in ſecret, then they can elſe-where. In publick, perhaps many a Petition is omitted,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170411:26"/>
and many a conſeſſion which is ſuitable to our private neceſſities. The Miniſter in the Church, and the Maſter in the Family, cannot meet ſo particularly with all my neceſſities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as I can do in private, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Private prayer hath not ſo many occaſions of diſtraction and interruption as the publick.</hi> The heart can keep more cloſe to God. In publick there are many averſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many objects upon which the eye faſtens. Many noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes after which the eare too much runs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the irreverence and vain carriage of others, are a great cooling to the affections of thoſe, who are good, many times in the publick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one gazing eye diſturbs many, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the demeanors of many is ſuch in the publick, that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is occaſion of much hurt to thoſe, who would have their hearts fixed, by their whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and talkings, and wandrings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they take off from the fervency of others; or elſe by the gariſh attire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In private, the duty may be performed, when the heart is in the best frame;</hi> for the publick, its not ſo much in our power, to undertake it at this ro that inſtant, when the heart is beſt turned, and moſt elevated. It is true, we ſhould alwayes have our hearts tuned for prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they are not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the publick you muſt pray, when others call, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>In private prayer, we have greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of learning to pray;</hi> for then we exerciſe our own gifts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in publick, we only hear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, exerciſe their parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we are more
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170411:27"/>
paſſive in the publick, more active in the private.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 2. <hi>Private Prayer is an Argument of greater love to the duty.</hi> A man may publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray, who hath not love to it, out of other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as to gain credit and applauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to perform the duty in a corner, when no eye ſees us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this evidenceth more affection. And its a greater Argument of ſincerity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That mans heart is not right in his publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, who is very ſeldom, or never in private devotion. <hi>Ille dolet verè qui ſine teſte, &amp;c.</hi> He prayes but hypocritically in the Church, or in the Family with others, who neglects praying alone. <hi>Vid.</hi> Matth. 6. 5, 6. An hypocrite is all for the publick, little for the private: ſincerity is equally for both. A Chriſtians heart is what it is when he is alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 3. <hi>He that neglects private prayer, ſhall be neglected in his publick prayer.</hi> If thou wilt not call upon God in ſecret, God will not hear thee in publick. Want of private duties, is the reaſon why the heart is ſo dead under the publick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ordinarily, that man or womans heart is beſt in publick, who is moſt frequent in private. Private duties fit the heart for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If thou wilt carefully call upon God in private, God will enable thee to ſerve him in publick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 4. <hi>Private prayer is more our own, then publick is,</hi> its perſonal ſervice. Its true, in ſome ſenſe, publick prayer is perſonal; but private and ſecret is more perſonal. A man in the publick, tenders up Confeſſions and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>titi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170411:27"/>
and Thankſgivings, by the mouth of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in private by his own mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 5. <hi>God hath uſually let out himſelf moſt to his people, when they have been alone at the Throne of Grace.</hi> There have been more melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and greater manifeſtations of God. <hi>Peter</hi> when he was alone on the houſe-top, ſees the viſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Acts 10. 11, 12. <hi>Daniel</hi> when he was alone a praying, hath the Angel diſparcht to him, with a Meſſage that he was greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, <hi>&amp;c.

They dreamed of an Earthly Kingdom, and earthly honours, therefore our Saviour preacheth ſo frequently of his ſufferings, to take them off from ſuch a conceit, and to prepare them for Tryal. And he doth not only foretell of his ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Its very profitable and neceſſary for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, when they preach of ſufferings,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170411:29"/>
to add ſomething concerning the iſſue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſufferings: when we ſpeak of Death, its good to mention the Reſurrection alſo. The Spirits of the beſt Chriſtians, will ſoon ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſufferings, if they be not acquainted with the victory they ſhall have over ſufferings. We finde in the Scripture, that when the Apoſtle ſpake any thing of the Croſſe, there is uſually mention made of the good iſſue of it, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8, 9. there is the Doctrine of the Croſſe.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170411:30"/>
                  <hi>ad finem.</hi> They <hi>hearing</hi> that Jeſus, who had done ſo many miracles, paſſed by, ſend out their cries after him. The multitude rebuke them, that they ſhould hold their peace: grace growes ſtronger by oppoſition, the more they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked, the lowder they cry. Their prayers and importunity ſtop the Lord Jeſus in his way: he calls them to him, reaſons with them, deſires to know why they called him. And upon the hearing of their deſire, grants their requeſt, <hi>He had compaſſion on them, and touched their eyes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In that part of the Verſe which I have read, we have two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An Act done, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that ſhewes the miracle, Chriſt could heal with a touch of his hemme ſometimes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 36.</p>
               <p>It ſhewes his condeſcenſion, that he would touch them, mean perſons, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 3. the Leper <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 15. the Fever, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 33. deaf, and the impediment of ſpeech, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 51. <hi>Malchus</hi> his eare.</p>
               <p>Note, <hi>The least touch of Chriſts finger,</hi> will cure perfectly the greateſt diſeaſe of ſoul, or of body. If Chriſt do but touch the hand, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is gone, the eyes are opened, &amp;c. If the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had the bloody iſſue for twelve years, do but touch his Garment, ſhe findes a preſent cure, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 25. &amp;c. when the Diſciples are overwhelmed with fear at Chriſts Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a touch of their Maſters hand revives them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 7. When <hi>Daniel</hi> is in his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170411:30"/>
overwhelmed, a very touch of the Son of man ſtrengthneth him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 18, 19. The hard heart is broken with a touch of Chriſts finger; the dead heart is quickned, if Chriſt doth but lay his hand upon it: the troubled conſcience is pacified and quieted, if Chriſt put but his finger <hi>in at the hole of the door:</hi> the deaf ear is unſtopped, the ſtammering tongue ſpeaks plainly, the frozen heart is thawed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If Chriſt do but touch the bier, the dead body is raiſed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 14.</p>
               <p>Nay, Our Saviour cures with leſſe then a touch. His very word healeth any Diſeaſe of ſoul or body. <hi>He cast out Devils with his word,</hi> a Legion out of one man, <hi>Thou unclean Spirit come out of him,</hi> Matth. 8. 16. He rebuked the fever with his word, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 39. The Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Son, who lay at point of death, labouring of a Fever, was healed with a word, ſpeaking at a diſtance, <hi>John</hi> 4. 50. 52. He hath abſolute power over all Diſeaſes of body, and all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual maladies, and when he ſaith, <hi>Go, they go,</hi> when he ſaith, Be removed, they depart imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
               <p>Nay, He can cure with the glance of his eye, which is leſſe then his word. When <hi>Peter's</hi> heart was grown hard with ſin: firſt denies, and then denies with <hi>Oaths and curſes that he knew not the man:</hi> Chriſt did but caſt his very eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and his heart relented preſently, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 61. As the very look of Chriſt can make the Earth to tremble, and his enemies to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, ſo the leaſt glance of his eye cures all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170411:31"/>
As he can kill with his touch, ſo can he cure with his touch. All <hi>Job's</hi> troubles, was nothing but a touch of Gods hand, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 21. He did but touch <hi>Jacob's</hi> thigh, and it was out of joynt preſently, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 25.</p>
               <p>The touch of his hand ſets the Hills a ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 32. ſo his touch revives, comforts, ſtrengthens. He did but put his finger through <hi>the hole of the door,</hi> and the languiſhing love-ſick Church was comforted, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 4, 5. He did but touch <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> mouth, and he was embolden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt all the contradictions of men, <hi>Ier.</hi> 1. 9. He did but touch the Prophet <hi>Eſays</hi> lips, and <hi>his iniquity was purged, and his guilt removed,</hi> Iſay 6. 7.</p>
               <p>1. Uſe. <hi>We have here a notable and clear proof of Chriſts Divinity from this paſſage.</hi> He that can open blinde eyes with the touch of his finger, is no leſſe then God undoubtedly, his touch is omnipotent.</p>
               <p>2d Uſe. <hi>It is a ground of exceeding great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and joy unto the Servants of Chriſt, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under many ſpiritual Infirmities.</hi> Its the condition of the Servants of God, to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed under many foul maladies; they have blinde mindes, dead hearts, cold affections, feavoriſh heats of inordinate and worldly love, they uſe many Medicines, and finde not heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Well, do not deſpait, do not deſpond, Chriſt hath a healing hand, his very touch can cure you prefectly of all; the very tip of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the very breath of his mouth, the very glance of his eyes can make your fleſh whole.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170411:31"/>
                  <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean,</hi> ſaith the Leper. <hi>I will,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>be thou clean,</hi> and <hi>immediately, his Leproſie was cleanſed,</hi> Matth. 8. 3. If he do but touch your eyes, they will be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; if he touch your tongue, it will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied; if he touch your hearts, they will relent; what though you have layn very long, and in your own thoughts, be ever at the point of death, yet his touch, his word can recover you. Jeſus Chriſt never ſent any diſeaſed perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for want of power, he never ſaid to any, the Diſeaſe is too far gone; no, though they lay gaſping for life, yet he wrought their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
               <p>Be ſtrengthned therefore, and you have the more reaſon to be ſo, if you conſider, that he is not only able, but willing too; for he hath compaſſion in him toward thoſe, who ſeek to him in their miſery, which is the ſecond part of the Text.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The impulſive cauſe of this act, viz.</hi> his own goodneſs <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to ſhew compaſſion, <hi>Intima miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recordia tangor.</hi> It anſwers the Hebrew word, <hi>rachamim,</hi> which ſignifies mercy proceeding from the bowels. And indeed, thats true mercy, which ſprings out of this Fountain, it muſt be ſpun out of the bowels, or elſe it is not true charity. <hi>There may be hand-charity, where there is no heart-charity.</hi> Therefore ye have
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170411:32"/>
the expreſſion, of <hi>drawing out of the ſoul to the hungry,</hi> Iſay 58. 10. Though we do ſatisfie the ſoul of the afflicted, yet if that do not ſpring from our very ſoul, 'tis not mercy, but hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>ſhutting up the bowels from the poor,</hi> Col. 3. 12. Though the doors be opened, to take in the wanderers, and the hand and purſe opened to relieve the needy and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, yet unleſs the bowels alſo be opened, it falls ſhort of true mercy.</p>
               <p>This is enough for the word. The Doctrine <note place="margin">Doct.</note> is this: <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, was exceeding compaſſionate towards thoſe who ſtood in need of mercy.</hi> He had bowels of compaſſion towards thoſe who were in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. He was very pittiful and tender hearted towards the diſtreſſed.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Towards the ſouls of men,</hi> he ſhewed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, <hi>vid.</hi> Mat. 9. 36, 37, 38. <hi>He ſets his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples a praying, when he ſaw how they were neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and diſtreſſed, for want of Preachers, to open to them the way of life, his ſoul was grieved for them.</hi> They perhaps had no compaſſion towards themſelves; perhaps, thought themſelves better without a Preacher, than with a Preacher, as many Congregations in this City, but Chriſt had compaſſion towards them: and in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next Chapter, ſends out his twelve Apoſtles, to preach the word to them for their ſalvation. This is the very firſt Commiſſion which Chriſt gives them, to preach. His very bowels yearned within him, to ſee ſouls periſh for want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Their ordinary Teachers which they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170411:32"/>
had, the Prieſts and Levites, and the Phariſees were as good as no Shepherds: therefore Chriſt out of meer compaſſion, ordains another Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry for them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſpiritual diſtempers of their hearts, was a great grief to his ſpirit,</hi> Mark 3. 5. <hi>He went up and down preaching in their Synagogues, and teaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom, conferring privately upon occaſion, with perſons about their ſouls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Towards their bodies, he was full of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) Whenſoever any came to him, for any cure of any malady upon himſelf, or any of his; his bowels were moved, &amp; he healed them, as theſe blinde men in the Text: the Leper comes to Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 41. Chriſt is <hi>moved with compaſſion towards him.</hi> We do not read of any that deſired cure, that were rejected. <hi>Vid.</hi> Mat. 15. 30.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>We finde many times, that even undeſired, he did acts of mercy to the distreſſed.</hi> Vid. Matth. 15. 32. he ſpreads a Table for them, was loath they ſhould faint by the way, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 12, 13. meeting with a Widdow of <hi>Naim,</hi> following her only Son to the grave, his bowels roll with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, and without being deſired, he raiſeth him up.

the wounded man by ſprawling in his blood, of his own accord, he goes and takes him up, and makes proviſion for him, he is the compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Samaritan.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>We finde, that he ſhed teares, when men had incur'd irrevocable miſery upon themſelves.</hi> That in <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 41. &amp;c. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had let ſlip the opportunities of her healing. This pierced his ſoul.</p>

               <p n="2">II. <hi>Compaſſion muſt not reſt and determine in words, but the condition of the afflicted muſt be alſo recommended to God by hearty prayer:</hi> words are but dry charity. Our Saviour, he puts up requeſts to God, for the diſtreſſes of men. He is praying for the Diſciples, when they are toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 23, 24.

               <p n="1">(1) By endeavouring to convince them that are impenitent of their ſins, and perſwading them to forſake their ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> by reproving, counſelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> labouring for their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by all meanes.

               <p n="1">(1) The Report of the Angels to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and of the Women to the Diſciples, verſ. 4, 5. ad 11.</p>

This Text is the Epitome, and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of our Saviours diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> A ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Collection out of the Scriptures of the old
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170411:42"/>
Teſtament, of all thoſe places which ſpeak of the Doctrine of his ſufferings and Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Theſe he alledgeth, and expounds in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Wherein we have two Parts.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) The matter of Chriſts Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The Text from whence he urgeth this Doctrine, or matter. I might obſerve this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, That <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much in them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 46. concerning Chriſt: Not any thing can be named concerning Chriſt; but <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, have it in one place or another. Chriſt, never ſince the Scriptures were, left his Church without a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Goſpel veiled: the Goſpel is <hi>Moſes</hi> unridled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Clearneſs. This is worthy to be noted, againſt thoſe who reject <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Antinomians,</hi> &amp;c. And tis worthy to be obſerved, to ſtir up Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to the reading of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Chriſt is there, as well as in the New Teſtament. His Birth, his Death, his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Interceſſion, Aſcention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His Natures, Offices, merit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Doctrines, not unknown to the old Teſtament. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets preach Chriſt as well as the Goſpel; and the Goſpel preaches <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, obedience as well as Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But that which I would commend to you, is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That our Lord Ieſus Christ was very profitable and fruitful in thoſe private communions and converſes which he had with men, while he was upon the Earth.</hi> He overtakes two Travellers
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170411:43"/>
in the way, and ſee here what his diſcourſe is, not vain and idle talk, not diſcourſe about the things of this life, nor is it about novelties, in which many men ſpend their time; but it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſpiritual matters, its Scripture-Diſcourſe, he doth here in a ſhort ſpace, run through, and interpret all the Scriptures in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which had any thing concerning thoſe excellent Doctrines of his death and exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as it was here, ſo we ſhall finde his practiſe in every company. In the 4th of <hi>John,</hi> verſ. 6. he, in his Travel, occaſionally meets with a <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, and ſee what his conference with her is, <hi>vid.</hi> verſ. 10. ad 29. not about things unprofitable, but about matters of ſalvation and eternal life: you may read what a glorious Sermon he makes to that poor Woman. In the 14th of <hi>Luke,</hi> he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to one of the chief Phariſees to a feaſt, verſ. 1. what is his diſcourſe there? not that frothy and ſinful diſcourſe which uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſuch meetings, but ſpiritual and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talk.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He preaches to the gueſts, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sermon of humility, verſ. 7. ad 12. obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their ambition, how they affected the higheſt rooms, he puts forth a Parable to them, to teach them lowlineſs of minde. When he hath done that, he begins another Diſcourſe with the Maſter of the houſe, and its the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of right feaſting and invitations, verſ. 12. ad 15. namely, to invite the poor and needy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not as though our Saviour would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170411:43"/>
or diſallow theſe friendly courteſies, ſhewed to Allies, or rich Neighbours and Kinsfolks, but that he might hereby refute that error of the Phariſees, who thought by ſuch acts, ſufficiently to fulfil the Law of charity, whereas indeed this was not charity, which extends it ſelf eſpecially to thoſe who are in want, but rather a covetous practiſe to bring in the like, or greater courteſies to our ſelves, from others. Therefore our Saviour tells him, feaſts ſhould be made for the poor, as well as for rich Neighbours and friends. The Phariſees enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and good cheare, ſhall not ſtop our Saviours mouth, but he will tell him of his duty. Chriſt is no Trencher-Chaplain, he will not ſmother any mans miſcarriages for his great proviſion. Many would perhaps, think it rudeneſs or incivility in our Saviour, to fall thus bluntly upon gueſts and hoaſt too, yet he doth it freely. Shortly after, one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany begins to break forth into the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the happineſs of thoſe, who ſhould enjoy life eternal, verſ. 15. hereupon, our Saviour, verſ. 16. ad 25. by an appoſite Parable ſhewes unto him, and all the reſt, how that happineſs might be attained, <hi>viz.</hi> by laying hold on, and receiving the offer of Chriſt, made in the preaching of the Goſpel, in which he doth ſet out the obſtinacy of the Jewes, in the refuſing of this tender, and alſo layes down the great danger of ſuch refuſal. Here's the excellent Table-talk of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:170411:44"/>
And if you trace him from houſe to houſe, from Company to Company, you will finde him alwayes ſpeaking to the good of thoſe who were with him, <hi>vid.</hi> John 5. 14. when he meets with the man, whom he had cured at the pool of <hi>Betheſda.</hi> When he comes to the houſe of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> John 11. 25. Luk. 10. 39. Chriſt falls to work, as ſoon as he comes, his diſcourſe is profitable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When he was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate with his Diſciples, his diſcourſe is alwayes edifying &amp;c. either he is expounding ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine delivered in publick, or elſe propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome new diſcourſe to them for their good. Would you know why? He hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded men, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 29. He obeys his own Rule.</p>
               <p>1. Reſol. <hi>His work was to convert men to God, and to edifie men converted.</hi> Therefore he took all opportunities for the accompliſhing of this end. This is the reaſon he gives his Diſciple for his conference with the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>John</hi> 4. 34. He was the great Seedſman whom God had ſent from Heaven, to ſow the ſeed of grace in the hearts of men: therefore he would be ſcattering it abroad, both in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick &amp; in private. The wiſe man gives counſel, which is exceeding good, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 6. Chriſt comming for this work, took all occaſions to perform it. He came for ſpiritual and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ends, therefore his diſcourſe looked that way.</p>
               <p>2d Reſol. <hi>Jeſus Christ was full of all grace and perfection:</hi> therefore he could not but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170411:44"/>
whereſoever he came, <hi>vid.</hi> John 1. 14. Col. 1. 19. He was an over-flowing Fountain, <hi>The Spirit was not given to him by meaſure, as it is to all his members, but above all meaſure,</hi> John 3. 34. The beſt of men have received but their ſcantling and proportion, God <hi>hath dealt to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, the meaſure of Faith,</hi> Rom. 12. 3. and ſo of every other grace, they have but a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and a ſmall meaſure too, therefore they cannot give out in ſuch abundance; But Chriſt had an unmeaſurable fulneſs, therefore in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Company he came, he could not but cauſe ſomething to flow out. He was ſo richly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed, that his ſavour went abroad in every place where he ſet his feet—.He had a full Heaven within him. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3d Reſol. <hi>His large affections to the ſouls of men, and his exceeding and abundant love to, and deſire of, the honour of his Father.</hi> He valued ſouls at a high rate: his heart was ſet upon the glorifying of his Father. Therefore he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes labouring for the advancement of him, both publickly and privately, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 4.</p>
               <p>4th Reſol. <hi>He knew he had but a ſhort time to continue amongſt men on Earth.</hi> He was he knew within a very little while, to remove from whence he came: therefore will he neglect no opportunity, wherein he may be uſeful to men.</p>
               <p>This Conſideration hath put forward the ſervants of Chriſt, to uſe all diligence, <hi>vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 14. And this alſo made our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

ſo careful, <hi>vid.</hi> John 13. 1. 3, 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a particular caſe.</p>
               <p>5th Reſol. <hi>Our Saviour knew the worth and preciouſneſs of time:</hi> therefore he would not loſe one moment. He was acquainted with the rareneſs of opportunity: what a Jewel it is. 'Tis true, he could make opportunity when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pleaſed. He was the Lord of time and opportunity. But being man as we are, he would teach us how to husband time, and how to lay hold upon, and improve opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity when tis offered. He hath given men a Command, <hi>to redeem time,</hi> Eph. 5. 16. And by his own example, he will put us upon the work, and ſhew us the worth of opportunity.</p>

The diſcourſe of Chriſt and ſalvation, and grace, <hi>&amp;c. theſe are as ſmoak to the eyes, and Gravel ſtones to the Teeth,</hi> unpleaſant, bitter, undelightful.

in this they can willingly ſpend dayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but conference about things Heavenly, makes them very melancholy and heavy.

Theſe are not the members of Chriſt, they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170411:46"/>
walk not like their Maſter. Chriſts Diſcourſe was of Heaven, and the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their diſcourſe is about ſin, and wickedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what the Apoſtle ſaith of ſome in his time, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their private actions, that they did ſuch things as <hi>was even ſhame to ſpeak of,</hi> Eph. 5. 12. we have cauſe enough to ſay, concerning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in our dayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> every place, where they come, keeps ſome infection, receives prejudice from them.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>It blames the best of us all, for our diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude to Chriſt, in this reſpect:</hi> where is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian much regards this duty? How unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly are many houres ſpent in private Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, even by the Servants of God, wherein there is ſcarce a word ſpoken for God, or which may edifie? The Servants of God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, were otherwiſe minded; <hi>They ſpake much one to another, about the things of God,</hi> Mal. 3. latter end. God was ſet up in the hearts of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 14, 15.</note> one another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now even many of Gods own people, have as little of God, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their occaſional converſings, as other men. This is one reaſon, why the power of godlineſs is ſo much abated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to what, it was in former times. What's the reaſon of this neglect?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Pride</hi> may be one hindrance: ſome have high parts, they will not ſtoop.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Want of heavenlineſs of minde,</hi> and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of affection to ſpiritual things. Chriſtians are grown more worldly, then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:170411:46"/>
3. <hi>Want of affection one to another.</hi> There is not that care in Chriſtians, one towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and one over another, which ſhould be. Whatever the cauſe be, 'tis utterly a fault, and that which Satan rejoyceth at.</p>
               <p>2d Uſe. <hi>Exhortation. Let every one, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in Christ, walk in this, as Chriſt walked,</hi> 1 John 2. 6. Improve your private converſe with men for their good. Edifie one another. Never meet together, but let ſomething be ſaid and done, that may tend to Gods honour, and the good of men. Supporting words to the weak, reproving ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> comforting words to the diſtreſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſet up God where you come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I would I could ſay ſomething to perſwade you to it. Conſider, two things are much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the godly; frequent meetings, and, improvement of meetings.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>The things of God and ſalvation, are of the greateſt worth and moment.</hi> There is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing ſo abſolutely neceſſary as theſe things. Indeed, there is nothing ſo deſerving of your time, as the things of God are. One houres time is of greater value then the World, time is too precious to be conſumed with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſes. If the worth of it were known, it would be improved. A Chriſtians breath is too good to be waſted about other things.<hi>—vid.</hi> Luk. 10. 42. <hi>Mary</hi> gets to Chriſts feet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to have ſomething out of him.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>This is the only way to make ſociety ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and comfortable.</hi> This is the chief and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170411:47"/>
principal end of Communion. Take away this, and there is not much difference between the ſociety of Chriſtians and Beaſts.</p>
               <p>They can eat together, and drink, and they can walk together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am ſure, take away this, and there is no advantage more from the ſociety of Chriſtians, then of other men. This ſweetens ſociety.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>God takes notice, and eſpecial regard of ſuch diſcourſe,</hi> vid. Mal. 3. 16. They lived in dayes of trouble and diſtreſs, when prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was promoted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they, when they met together, uſed to exhort, and comfort one another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and God hearkens to them, and makes them a gracious promiſe. <hi>They ſhall be mine, &amp;c. and I will ſpare them, as a man ſpareth his own Son that ſerveth him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4) <hi>God will call all men to account, for the improving of their Communion with others.</hi> God never caſts his people into any Company, or ſociety, but he either ſends them to deliver ſomething from him to others, or to receive ſomething from others for their good.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) <hi>Men of all Employments, when they do meet together, will be diſcourſing about the things which belong to their own Calling and kind of life.</hi> Your Lawyers will be putting Caſes. Phyſitians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Cures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Stateſmen of Politicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, even wicked men, when they come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will be reaſoning, conſulting, their wicked projects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſhould not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian be diſcourſing about his Trade?</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:170411:47"/>
(6) <hi>There is ſometimes a greater liberty of ſpeaking in private then in publique.</hi> Chriſtians have greater liberty in private, then the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the Pulpit.</p>
               <p n="7">(7) <hi>You will exerciſe your own Talents much by this meanes,</hi> warm your own hearts. <hi>There is that ſcattereth, yet increaſeth; he that water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſhall be watered himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">(8) <hi>By this meanes, you may prevent much ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpeaking.</hi> Grace and Piety hath a majeſty in it, even amongſt wicked men; a few who are godly and religious, may by ſpeaking of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſtop the mouth of prophaneneſs.</p>
               <p n="9">(9) <hi>Conſider how much hurt you have done in many Companies heretofore:</hi> perhaps you have deaded many a heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">(10) <hi>How greatly God hath bleſſed the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of many of his Servants, in matters of this nature.</hi> Our Saviours Diſcourſe in private, was the firſt converſion of that <hi>Samaritan</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> John 4. and in this place, verſ. 3 2. he ſets his Diſciples hearts on fire: many have found a Reproof in private, carried home by God, and an Inſtruction brought to the heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The very preſence of ſome good men hath reſtrained ſwearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and reſtrained ſin, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>11. All thoſe Motives which moved Jeſus Chriſt, may be as goads in our ſides. Was it his work to convert men, &amp; ſo ſhould be ours:—did this argue grace in Chriſt, that he was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170411:48"/>
full of grace; ſo it will argue, thou haſt grace: this will evidence thy affections to the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and immortal ſouls of the Brethren.</p>
               <p>When thou heareſt a ſwearer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thou mayſt die before thou ſee him again, or death may ſnatch him away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do all the good whileſt you may.</p>
               <p>When others get Play-books, Newes-books into their hands, or Sr. <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> &amp;c. Do you take <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and read them together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This would recover the decayed power of godlineſs, bring a new ſpring after a long win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and be very much to the honour of God and Religion.</p>
               <p>The Trade of godlineſs would be driven on, and prophaneneſs will wither, and go down exceedingly.—The Trade of error is driven by peoples jangling and diſputing, this courſe would drive on the Trade of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>You are to have a care of others, as well as your ſelves. Thy Brother is thy charge, and thou art his charge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heb. 10. 24.</p>

               <p>A Miniſter in a private Family, may do as much good ſometime, as in the Church.</p>
               <p>It is a ſad thing to conſider, that many a Chriſtian Miniſter is very familiar with this, or the other great man, but the family gets no good by their comming, <hi>&amp;c. Elijah</hi> did good

               <p>THis Prophet is well ſtiled by one of the Ancients the fifth <hi>Evangelist,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſo much Goſpel in his Writings.

               <p>This Chapter is the Model and Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of the whole Goſpel. Here we have both the Humiliation, and the Exaltation of Chriſt,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170411:50"/>
his low debaſement, and his high advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The former is from Verſ. 1. ad 10. The latter is from verſ. 10. <hi>ad finem.</hi>

                  </gap>, we have two things eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) A ſad complaint of the Worlds rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, ver. 1. <hi>Who hath believed,</hi> &amp;c. or, <hi>to whom the Arm of the Lord revealed, i. e.</hi> the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the preaching of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
               <p>Few of thoſe who heart the Goſpel, do truly receive and embrace it. The <hi>Arm</hi> of God is <hi>ſtretched out</hi> to many, its <hi>revealed</hi> effectually to a very few. <hi>Many are called, few are choſen.</hi> It was ſo in the Apoſtles time, in Chriſts time, it will be ſo in our time. It may be a ſupport to the Miniſtry and Miniſters, when their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours prove ſucceſleſs: if the Miniſtry of Chriſt and his Apoſtles was fruitleſs to many, why ſhould we be dejected?</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The Reaſon of this Rejection, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The meanneſs of his perſon,</hi> and Kingdom outwardly in the firſt Original of it, verſ. 2. <hi>He ſhall grow up, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. His ſufferings and afflictions, verſ. 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Kingdom was but mean, and his ſufferings were great; his croſſe was a ſcandal to many.</p>
               <p>The Exaltation, verſ. 10. <hi>ad finem,</hi> hath many things in it. Chriſts exaltation in his ſeed, v. 10, 11. His exaltation in his perſon, v. 12.</p>
               <p>In the Text, we have two things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Deſcription of the great ſufferings of Chriſt, in theſe words. <hi>Oppreſſed, afflicted, brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, as a Sheep to</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:170411:50"/>
                  <hi>the Shearer. In voce [Pecudis] forte alluſio est ad legales victimas; quo ſenſu alibi vocatur Agnus Dei.</hi> John 1. 29. 36. <hi>Calvin. in Locum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. His carriage under thoſe ſufferings. <hi>He was dumb, he opened not his mouth: ſo he opened not his mouth.</hi> Expreſſions of his patience, and contentment, which is amplified by the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a ſheep.</p>
               <p>Here are two Leſſons in the words.</p>
               <p>1. Doct. <hi>The Lord Jeſus did ſuffer very much of men, while he was in the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2d Doct. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, did with great patience and contentedneſs, bear thoſe ſufferings which he lay under.</hi> I made choice of this Text, becauſe of this ſecond Doctrine, that I might ſpeak to you of our Saviours patience, which is another vertue for our Imitation. But becauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is very profitable, I ſhall ſpend this hour about that.</p>
               <p>1 Doct. <hi>The Lord Jeſus did ſuffer very much while he was on Earth.</hi> He was a very great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer. He is called here, by this Prophet, <hi>vir Dolorum, peritus infirmitatis,</hi> verſ. 3. We read here, of deſpiſing, rejected, ſtripes, ſmitings, wounds, ſorrows, bruiſing, chaſtizement, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, affliction, cutting off, <hi>putting to grief, and powring out his ſoul to death.</hi> Gather all theſe together, and they will make up a very great ſufferer.</p>
               <p>I ſhall do two things for explication.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What Chriſt ſuffered,</hi> the kindes of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Why he ſuffered,</hi> the cauſes of it.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>For the Nature of his ſufferings,</hi> he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170411:51"/>
every kind of way. He ſuffered from men. And he ſuffered from God. He ſuffered in his Body, in his Soul, in his Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He ſuffered Revilings, and Reproaches, He was a ſcorn of men, and deſpiſed of the People, Pſal.</hi> 22. 6, 7. How often ſhall you ſee him laughed to ſcorn in the Goſpel? how often do you read of his deridings? <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 40. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 35. <hi>Friend of Publicans.</hi> He was called <hi>Belzebub,</hi> Deceiver, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 63.

               <p n="1">1. In the Kingly Office. <hi>They put a Scepter in his hand, a Crown on his Head, bowed their knee, ſaying, hail King of the Jewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In his Prieſtly Office. They put upon him a <hi>gorgeous white Robe,</hi> ſuch as the Prieſts weare.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his Prophetical Office, when they had blind-folded him, <hi>Propheſie, ſay they, who it is that ſmiteth thee.</hi> Sometimes they ſaid, <hi>Thou art a Samaritan, and he hath a Devil.</hi> Sometimes, <hi>He is beſide himſelf, why hear ye him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He ſuffered ſtripes, ſpittings, buffettings,</hi> Iſa. 59. 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He ſuffered falſe accuſations,</hi> from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned witneſſes. <hi>He ſaid, Deſtroy the Temple of God, and in three dayes I will build it up,</hi> and <note place="margin">

               <p n="5">5. <hi>He ſuffered Death it ſelf,</hi> a ſhameful, painful death, crucified between two Theeves, as a malefactor.</p>

                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:170411:51"/>
In his ſoul he ſuffered from God. Deſertion, ſweated blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Temptation, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> In a word, he ſuffered the whole wrath of God.

From them in the Miniſtry: From Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>Why he ſuffered?</p>

(2) <hi>It was from the conſideration and certain knowledge of the benefit which would redound and accrue to his Elect, by his ſufferings.</hi> He knew his ſufferings would accompliſh the Salvation and Redemption of his people, it would ſave them from their ſins, and reconcile them to God, who were enemies by Nature. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he did it patiently, out of meer love to mans ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

He was in Travel for our ſalvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a Woman in Travel, endures grief with patience, out of love to her fruit, which ſhe hopes to ſee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His impriſonment would let many out of priſon; His oppreſſion would be our Redemption; His death would be our life; His wounds our heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and His bruiſing, our ſtrengthning, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> He knew his being caſt over-board, would calm the wrath of God to us ward: therefore he did ſilently throw himſelf into the Sea.</p>
               <p>(3) <hi>That he might ſet us a pattern of bearing our croſſes with patience:</hi> our Saviour knew, that afflictions and troubles abide over all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, while they are in this time. He knew that thoſe whom his Father foreknew, them he <hi>predestinated to be conformable unto his Son,</hi> Rom. 8. 29.

Therefore he would

not only by his Command, but by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, teach them this leſſon. This is that which the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21, 22, 23. And hence it is, that the Apoſtle doth ſo often preſſe this grace, from the patience of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>This is the firſt thing what it implies, what this duty is.</p>
               <p>The 2d thing is to give Motives, to this patient and ſilent bearing: for which conſider theſe.</p>
               <p>1. Motive. <hi>Conſider, that all conditions are ordered by, and according to the will and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, vid.</hi> Matth. 10. 29. <hi>Iob</hi> 5. 6. This was that that ſilenced <hi>Iob,</hi> under very heavy preſſures, Cap. 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Not the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> or <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> but the hand of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:170411:59"/>
This very conſideration ſilenced <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. and ſo <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 39. 9. and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10. <hi>Abiſhai</hi> looks no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>Shimei,</hi> and therefore he is all on hot fire, <hi>let me go, and take away his head from him. David</hi> ſees a Commiſſion in his hand from Heaven, <hi>Ergo. Vid.</hi> Acts 21. 13. they took on very much at firſt hearing; but when they were once perſwaded that it was from God, they did acquieſſe, the <hi>will of the Lord be done.</hi> And the great Motive which kept our Saviour ſo ſilent under all his ſufferings, was this. <hi>The Cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider 1. Gods Soveraignty and Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He hath an abſolute right to order of things, as he pleaſeth, to ſet us higher or lower, to bring us into bondage or freedom. <hi>Ergo, vid. Iob</hi> Cap. 38. <hi>per totum.</hi> Cap. 39. Cap. 40. 5. Theres no man hath ſuch power over his beaſt, to put him to a fat or lean paſture, as God hath over man, <hi>vid. Iob</hi> 11. 10. Not to be ſilent, is either to deny, or at beſt, to queſtion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute Gods Dominion over him. 'Tis as much as to ſay, He is his own, not the Lords.</p>
               <p>2. Conſider his wiſdom. All the works which God doth, have rayes of Divine wiſdom in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 24. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 11. Even the moſt confuſed and ſeemingly diſordered wayes and works of God, are wrought moſt wiſely and artificially. Now not to be ſilent, is to lay to the charge of God folly, bungling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2d Motive. <hi>Conſider, that you have deſerved</hi>

                  <hi>many times more and heavier things from the hands of God.</hi> Art thou in poverty? thou haſt deſerved beggery. Art thou in ſickneſs? thou haſt deſerved death. Art thou in a priſon? Hell is not beyond thy demerits? <hi>vid. Lam.</hi> 3. 39. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. This conſideration was that which did ſilence that good Thief upon the Croſſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 41. A Man who hath deſerved hanging, drawing, and quartering, may well be ſilent to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go whipping, or burning in the hand. He who had confiſcated all his Eſtate, by ſome illegal Act, hath no reaſon to ſpeak, becauſe the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer comes to demand 6 <hi>d.</hi> or 12 <hi>d.</hi> for a fine. Juſt thus it is with us, we have deſerved the loſſe of all, and the Lord only takes twelve pence as it were, from us. The <hi>wages of ſin is death,</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>ult.</hi> and that eternal. And this is the wages of every ſin. Now we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted an innumerable number of ſins, beſide that unfathomed Fountain of corrupt nature which hath all ſin in it, in the principle; And yet God comes but with ſmall rods to whip us, and that in meaſure too: we may well hold our peace indeed.</p>
               <p>3d Motive. <hi>Conſider the great good of this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> and patience under our afflictions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Tis in it ſelf, a very excellent and precious grace,</hi> full of beauty and glory. It renders us moſt like to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Tis very precious in the effects of it.</hi> I will ſhew you theſe four effects of it.</p>

patient Chriſtian. <hi>Levius fit patientia Quicquid corrigere eſt nefas.</hi> Yea, it doth take away the whole weight of the burthen. For when the ſpirit is in ſuch a frame, tis all one, whether poverty or riches, whether freedom or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A patient ſpirit, hath the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and comfort of his condition ſtill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It makes a ſoul Conqueror over all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The impatient complaining ſpirit is van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed under every ſmall ſuffering, his ſpirit <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37.</note> is quite overcome, whereas the patient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth tryumph, and gets the Victory over all diſtreſſes. <hi>Iob</hi> by his patience, did conquer all his troubles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It preſerves and keeps a Chriſtian from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſnares and temptations;</hi> which affliction and diſtreſs, puts a man upon. There is no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it hath its peculiar temptations. Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, reproach, perſecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As it is a hard thing, ſo it is a happy thing to be preſerved from theſe ſnares. Not to ſteal in poverty, not to apoſtatize in perſecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the beſt Antidote and Preſervative to keep us from theſe. The patient Chriſtian, will not think of any ſhifts which are ſinful, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf. The faith and patience of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Martyrs, was that which kept them from accepting of deliverance upon ſinful termes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35.</p>
               <p>The anſwer of that Martyr to his friends, when they would have had him to make an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape out of Priſon, was wrought by his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. No, <hi>He would ſtay Gods time. He would</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:170411:60"/>
                  <hi>not come out when his friends deſired,</hi> then he <hi>ſhould come out too ſoon;</hi> nor <hi>when his enemies would have him, then he ſhould ſtay too long, but when God would have him, that was the beſt time.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> Acts 16. 26. The Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors were all open, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they would not ſtir. Patience prevents many ſuch Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It prevents ſinful complyances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It fortifies the ſoul againſt the fear of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous conditions, when threatned or imminent.</hi> Tis a happy thing, to be freed from fear of evil, and tis promiſed to the godly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 7, 8. Now nothing is more likely to ſupport the ſoul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fear of ſuch ſtorms, then this grace of patience. The patient Chriſtian is provided for the worſt ſtorm. Patience is his Tower, his Anchor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's a ſetling grace.</p>
               <p>4th Motive. <hi>Conſider, that the preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is alſo ſimply the beſt condition for thee,</hi> if thou art a true Chriſtian. Poverty is better then riches, ſickneſs then health, bondage then free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Winter then Summer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tis beſt for thy ſelf, tis beſt for thy graces, tis beſt to bring thee to Repentance, tis beſt to humble thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tis beſt, conſidering the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper which is in thy heart.</p>
               <p>Conſider 1. <hi>Gods Wiſdom,</hi> that he knowes what is beſt.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>His goodneſs,</hi> that he will not put any Child of his, out of a better eſtate, into a worſe.</p>
               <p>God ſees thou haſt a proud heart, God knoweth thou haſt an ambitious heart; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170411:61"/>
diſgrace is better then a ſtate of honour. A tender Father would never correct his Child, but that he thinks that correction is better at that time, then cockering and indulgence: he would never deny him a meales meat, but that he ſees that faſting is better then food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo God, <hi>vid.</hi> Heb. 12. 10. The Apoſtle teacheth us, that God doth aym at his Childrens profit, and advantage in all his diſpenſations. Now if one State or Diſpenſation, were better then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and God ſhould caſt him into a worſe, out of a better, then it could not be true, that <hi>God</hi> in all his dealings, aymes at their benefit.</p>
               <p>5th <hi>Motive.</hi> Conſider, that there is a far greater good in patience and Chriſtian ſilence, then there is, or can be hurt or evil in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Croſſe. For mans happineſs, lyeth not in comforts, but in a complyance in his will, to the will of <hi>God.</hi> Patience is abſolutely a grace, affliction is not abſolutely a curſe. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6th Motive. <hi>Conſider, that God will put a good iſſue to all your ſad conditions.</hi> The end will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be good, <hi>vid.</hi> Jam. 5. 11. The hopes and expectation of this, prevailed upon the Church, to be ſilent under all her long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious darkneſs, <hi>vid.</hi> Mich. 7. 9. <hi>When I ſit in darkneſs, the Lord will be a light unto me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will bear, &amp;c.</hi> Your reproach ſhall end in honour, your diſgrace in glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 7. yea, your glory ſhall exceed your ſhame; yea, it ſhall be double to your ſhame. And your Croſſe, ſhall bring you to a Crown, <hi>vid. Iſa.</hi> 66. 5.</p>

It may be in this World, they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached you, ſhall change their Language, and bleſſe you. It ſometimes falls out ſo. You have a promiſe of this, made to the Church, <hi>vid. Iſa.</hi> 60. 14. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 9. We have examples, and inſtances of this. <hi>Haman,</hi> and the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with him: and ſo did <hi>Iobs</hi> friends. Cap. <hi>ult.

               <p>There are three great Arguments in that one Text. Explain it.</p>
               <p>7th Motive, <hi>Conſider the evil of Impatience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis a mighty torment to the ſoul.</hi> 'Tis a worm at the heart, which gnaweth continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It weakens the Spirits, and renders a man more unable to bear his croſſe; yea, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and diſcontent, is heavier then the burden it ſelf. The nayl in the yoak is much more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing then the yoak it ſelf, and galls more. Impatience is as a nayl in the croſſe: What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the cruel man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 17. we may ſay of the impatient, its a degree of ſelf-murther, it waſts and exhauſts the Spirits, what the Apoſtle ſaith of <hi>worldly ſorrow, that it works death,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. is true of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

               <p n="1">(1) <hi>Get ſelf-denyall, Matth.</hi> 16. 24. Could we deny our ſelves in point of honour, we would not ſtorme at reproach. So of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170411:63"/>

               <p n="2">(2) <hi>Labour for humility,</hi> conſider the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition patient in Spirit is oppoſed to pride of Spirit. Price is the mother of murmuring and diſcontent. Pride makes the Spirit furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: vid. <hi>Pro.</hi> 13. 10. A proud man will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with <hi>God.</hi> Pride thinks all the good he hath too little, all the evill he endures too much: humility, contrary,</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>Labour for a life of Faith.</hi> To make up all wants in <hi>God, Phil.</hi> 3. 20. This quieted <hi>David, pſal</hi> 42. 11. This kept the Apoſtles from fainting under their trouble, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. This was that which kept <hi>David</hi> quiet under great afflictions, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6.

               <p n="4">(4) <hi>Conſider often the patience of Chriſt,</hi> vid. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. 20. 21, 22. This, if it were well ſtudied, would alone allay all diſcontents. Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions had a ſting in them to Chriſt, and yet he was meek in induring. They were full of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wrath, Chriſts ſuffrings were ſcorpions, yours are but rods of men; Chriſts were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, yours are juſt; Chriſts were for others, yours are for your ſelves: we ſhould not be ſuch lions, as we are, if we could but get our hearts upon the meekneſſe of this Lambe.

(5) <hi>Conſider how many preſent comforts you yet enjoy.</hi> If ſuperfluities be gone, you have conveniences ſtill, you have peace within ſtill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> vid. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 8. we have our eyes ſtill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon what we want, or upon what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. This mercy is removed, this mercy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This heates the heart and makes it mutiny, whereas if we would but ſet before our eyes our preſent enjoyments, we would be quiet, for we ſhall ſee that what is removed, is juſtly taken away, and what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, is not only juſtly denyed, but in mercy: we want nothing but that the preſence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would be for our diſadvantage, neither do we loſe any thing, but that the preſence whereof would annoy us. We are like <hi>Haman</hi> in this reſpect<hi>:</hi> All he had was nothing, while <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> the Jew was at the Kings gate, and would not bow to him, vid. <hi>Est.</hi> 5. 13. one diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent deprives us of the ſweetneſſe of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.

They had long lived in a good land to no purpoſe. He that ſhall well conſider what little uſe he hath made of his health, while he enjoyed it, will not rage againſt God in a time of ſickneſſe, ſo for ſtrength in a time of weakneſſe, for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in a time of bondage, what good uſe did you make of your liberty while you had it? ſo for riches in a time of poverty. Did not you
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170411:64"/>
uſe all theſe for Gods diſhonour, for your brethrens hurt, for your own prejud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice?</p>
               <p n="7">(7) <hi>Conſider the patience of Saints.</hi> Their ſpirits were quiet under as great ſufferings as yours can be. Look upon Prophets, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Apoſtles, ſee their carriage. This is the Apoſtles direction, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 10. Thus were men highly honoured of God; ſo much is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in that expreſſion, <hi>Who have ſpoken in the name of the Lord.</hi> They ſuffered much, and they ſuffered quietly. Now the argument is ſtrong, Shall a holy Prophet, ſhall one who <hi>came in the name of the Lord</hi> to the world, ſhall they be patient under their ſufferings, and will you ſpeak? Thou who art far behind the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the Prophets in worth, in grace, in knowledge, &amp;c. will you be unquiet? Shall ſuch as <hi>Eſay, Ieremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> and other great Prophets be ſo ſilent, and will you rage? Nay, we may not onely take the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets for an example of patience, but the Apoſtles too. They ſuffered not onely ſilently, but joyfully.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Conſider, How much better it is with you, then with others.</hi> Are there many <hi>above you?</hi> well, but there are more <hi>below you, &amp;c.</hi> If thou wert the loweſt of all the Sons of men, it were thy duty to be quiet; but there are 1000. above thee in grace, in ſervice, in obedience, who are yet very far below thee in miſery in ſufferings. Art thou weak? others there are, that lye bed-rid, art thou in fear of a priſon? There are better
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170411:65"/>
then thou in cloſe bondage? Doſt thou drink thy teares? others there are, who drink blood. Art thou in the fire of perſecution? There are many in the fire of Hell. 'Tis our fault, we are alwayes looking to them, who are above us, ſuch and ſuch, they have friends, they have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they are in high places, they have not my croſſes, they feel non of my pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> well, but are there none in the World, thinkeſt thou, that eſteem thy condition as happy in reſpect of theirs? 'Tis very good counſel, the Apoſtle gives us, That we would make our <hi>ſelves equal with them of low degree,</hi> vid. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 16. If we would do thus in this matter, it would (through God) go very far to the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of us.</p>
               <p>There is much difference between the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of our ſpiritual and our outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with others. In comparing our ſpiritual condition, we ſhould meaſure with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, that we may be excited to growth; but in comparing of our outward condition, we ſhould meaſure with the loweſt, that we may be preſerved from repining.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Frequent Prayer.</hi> He that is ſeldom in prayer, will be frequent in repining; and he who is much in prayer, will be very little in murmuring. Prayer will allay heates of ſpirit. Prayer will expel the venom of impatience. <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer to God, made his ſoul ſo ſilent under his ſufferings, <hi>vid. Pſal.</hi> 39. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>In Prayer, the ſoul hath a view of <hi>God,</hi> which doth much quiet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:170411:65"/>
In Prayer, the ſoul hath an interview of it ſelf, and a view of ſin.</p>
               <p>Prayer, layes the ſoul low in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Prayer, kindles faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſees an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue out of trouble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Be much in the Duty of Thanksgiving.</hi> It is the Duty of a Chriſtian, to give thanks in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very condition, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 18. Now he that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in Thanksgiving, will be preſerved from impatience. Impatience will take us off from hearty giving of thanks; and giving of thanks will drive away murmuring. <hi>Doth a Fountain ſend forth ſweet waters, and bitter at one place? out of the ſame mouth proceedeth there bleſſings and curſings?</hi> Jam. 3. 10, 11. He that ſees cauſe why he ſhould give thanks, will ſee no reaſon why he ſhould murmur; and he that can finde in his heart to murmur, will hardly ever bleſſe <hi>God</hi> ſo heartily as he ſhould: where there is much of due bleſſing of <hi>God,</hi> there will be little, or none at all, of murmuring; which indeed is no better then curſing and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Conſider the Divine Calling.</hi> Chriſtians are under no troubles or ſufferings; but if they can ſee that they are called thereunto by the Lord, the very Call of <hi>God</hi> may quiet their hearts.

               <p>(2) And that which is moſt ſtrong is the Authority of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> who writing his ſecond Epiſtle to theſe very <hi>Hebrews,</hi> makes mention of an Epiſtle written to them by <hi>Paul</hi> which was then received by the Church as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. 16.</note> Scripture. This Epiſtle was now in their hands, and by them acknowledged to be <hi>Pauls.</hi> Now we do not find any Epiſtle writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to them beſides this. And it is not likely that through negligence they would loſe ſuch a rich Jewell recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to their ſtudy by two ſuch Apoſtles; or that they ſhould loſe that of <hi>Paul,</hi> and reſerve and keep this of <hi>Peter's</hi> which makes mention of that,</p>
               <p>The matter of this Epiſtle is threefold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He labours to take off theſe beleeving Hebrewes from the obſervation of the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ceremonies, whereunto they were too
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170411:68"/>
much inclined, and to perſwade with them to entertaine the Goſpell in the ſimplicity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This he endeavours to do, by ſetting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes the excellency of Jeſus Chriſt in his perſon, and in his Propheticall and Prieſtly office. This he doth from the beginning of the Epiſtle to the 23. v. of Chapter 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To encourage them to ſtand faſt in the profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit perſecution ſhould ariſe for the Truth, yet they ſhould not prove Apoſtates and Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's, but as that Cloud of witneſſes which he ſets before them had done, ſo they ſhould be conſtant to the death. This is from cap. 10. 23. v. to the end of the twelfth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To exhort them to the practiſe of many neceſſary Chriſtian Duties, Chapter 13. v. 1. <hi>ad finem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this third Chapter he exhorts them that from all that diſcovery he had made of Chriſt's Perſon and propheticall office in the two former Chapters, they would be perſwaded to embrace him, and to take heed that they did not fall through unbeliefe and hardneſſe of heart, from the profeſſion of the faith they had received, ver. 1. Wherefore, &amp;c. He uſeth many arguments in this Chapter, amongſt others this is one in the Text, drawen from the fidelity of Chriſt; which that he may enſorce the better, he makes a deliberate compariſon of Chriſt and <hi>Moſes.</hi> They had high opinions of <hi>Moſes's</hi> fidelity in appointing the Legall ſervices; but
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170411:69"/>
for Chriſt they had not ſuch high thoughts of him as it was meet they ſhould have had; The Apoſtle therefore compares Chriſt and <hi>Moſes</hi> together, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Thus you have the Text.</p>
               <p>Tis a glorious commendation of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtleſhip.</p>
               <p>In which we have two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The thing commended, He was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpecification of the perſon to whom this fidelity was ſhewed, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, namely to the Father, for he made him both Prieſt and Prophet to his Church. Or if you pleaſe, you may obſerve rather.</p>

He had a Divine call to the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all thoſe offices which he ſuſteined as our mediator. <hi>He did not run before he was ſent,</hi> he did not act without a due Commiſſion and Warrant.

               <p>2. Things. 1. That Chriſt is made. 2. How he is made.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) That he is appointed.</p>
               <p>He hath both miſſion and commiſſion for this great ſervice. (1) This is that which the Scripture holds out clearly in generall. <hi>He is made to us of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, Wiſedome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. there is his conſtitution, <hi>God hath given him</hi> to be the head of all things to his Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22.

God hath <hi>put all judgment</hi> into the hand of his Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22. and God <hi>hath given him Authority</hi> to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgement, becauſe he is the Son of God, ver 27. when the fulnes of time was come, <hi>God ſent his Son</hi> made of a woman, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. And our Saviour in the Goſpell doth many times make mention of his Fathers ſending, My Doctrine is not mine, but his that <hi>ſent me, Joh.</hi> 7. 16.

               <p>(2) This we ſhall find aſſerted <hi>of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular branch of his office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>For his Prieſtly office.</hi> He was made a Prieſt by an immediate call and ordination from God, <hi>vid. Pſal.</hi> 110. 4. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4, 5, 6. The ſcope of the Apoſtle in that Chapter is to ſet out the excellency of Chriſts Prieſthood, by comparing it with the Leviticall: his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood had a concurrence of all things neceſſary to the Leviticall, and it had many excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170411:70"/>
about that<hi>:</hi> amongſt other things required in the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> this was one, there muſt be a Divine regualr Call. This was in the Prieſthood of Chriſt. He was <hi>called of God</hi> an high Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>For his Kingly office.</hi> Hee is lawfully created. The Scepter is given into his hand, the Crown is put upon his head, by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

The Government is put upon his Shoulders,</hi> vid. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 22. 20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Eliakim</hi> was a figure of the Kingdome of Chriſt, and if you look into <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 13. 14. after that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of the four Monarchies we have the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of Chriſts Monarchy, and we ſee the <hi>Ancient of dayes gave</hi> his dominion, &amp;c. Chriſt did not thruſt himſelf into the Throne as many do, though they leape over the heads of the right heyres; no he ſtayed till Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was given him, vid. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8. 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 2.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>For his Propheticall office.</hi> He hath his thority from God for this alſo. <hi>Moſes</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this long agoe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 18. he did not raiſe himſelf, <hi>God raiſed</hi> him to this great office. He was <hi>anointed of God</hi> to preach glad tidings, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61. 1.</p>
               <p>In a word, whatſoever work belongs to Chriſt as mediator, tis put into his hands by a power Divine. The Father loveth the Son and <hi>hath</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:170411:71"/>
                  <hi>given</hi> all things into his hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 35. He hath <hi>ordained him to be Judge of quick and dead,</hi> Acts 10. 42.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) How hee is made and appointed. Here are three things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>There is a Divine Decree,</hi> by which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is from all eternity appointed for this ſervice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7. Yea there is the oath of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 4. <hi>vid. Heb.</hi> 6, 20. 22.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) By Covenant, <hi>There is a firme Covenant,</hi> and ſtipulation paſſed between God and Chriſt, <hi>vid. Eſa.</hi> 53. 10. Chriſt was to undertake an office of ſervice and obedience for the good of men. To take mans nature, to offer himſelf up a Sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for this, God was to <hi>prolong his dayes,</hi> to give him <hi>a ſeed,</hi> the <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of the earth for his inheritance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide him a ſpoil with the great,</hi> &amp;c. to ſet a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. vid. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9. 10.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) <hi>There is a very ſolemn and publike Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation</hi> of the eternall Decree by <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, firſt to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Then at the Baptiſme of Chriſt; by vertue of which Chriſt is declared to be appointed for this work, We read of it, <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 17. and repeated againe at his transfiguration, <hi>Math.</hi> 17. 5. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. And afterwards by his Apoſtles who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to teſtifie, that he was ordained of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>By Divine unction,</hi> which was the work of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 9. The holy Ghoſt <hi>formed him in the womb, anointed</hi> his humane nature, &amp;c.</p>

                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:170411:71"/>1. Uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Information.</hi> (1) That the work of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is a work which God doth exceedingly approve and delight in, as well as Jeſus Chriſt. Tis the Father's work, as well as the work of Chriſt, <hi>My Meate,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt, is to do the work of him that ſent me, Joh.</hi> 4. 34. He that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points another for a work, is as well the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, as he that doth the work appointed. Tis called <hi>the pleaſure of the Lord, Eſa.</hi> 53. 10. though it be put into the hands of Chriſt. We only look at Jeſus Chriſt in the work of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeldome or but little at the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we are to look at the Father's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as at the Son's accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>(2) <hi>That thoſe who reject Jeſus Chriſt, they reject God himſelf,</hi> by whoſe Authority and power Chriſt is made Lord, King, Prieſt, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Our Saviour oftentimes in the Goſpell hints this, <hi>My doctrine is not mine but his that ſent me,</hi> and <hi>he that rejecteth me, rejecteth him that ſent me,</hi> &amp;c. Tis a great aggravation of the rejecting of Chriſt becauſe he is Authoriz'd by a Commiſſion from the Father, vid. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 21.</p>
               <p>(3) <hi>That the Salvation of the Church of God by Ieſus Chriſt is bottom'd and builded upon a ſure and ſtable foundation.</hi> Its builded upon Chriſt, and Chriſt is appointed to that work by the ſupreme Authority of all. All thoſe who have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170411:72"/>
layed hold on Chriſt, are fled to a ſure refuge and Sanctuary. He is verily that Meſſiah, in whom all the Patriarchs and Prophets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, vid. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Gods</hi> call is mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>(4) <hi>That all the Lawes, Ordinances, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations appointed by Ieſus Chriſt, are of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority.</hi> Baptiſme, Miniſtry, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Cenſures, and every thing he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Church, are of <hi>God.</hi> Thus are all according to the inſtructions given him by God.</p>

               <p>(2) Tis a dangerous thing to take any work without a due appointment. What doſt you heare <hi>Elijah?</hi> Chriſt would not be a judge, Man who made me a Judge?</p>

3. <hi>He was faithfull in his Priestly office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were two parts of this office.</p>
               <p>Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Interceſſion.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Satisfaction is that whereby Jeſus Chriſt having taken our nature upon him, did in that Nature make full ſatisfaction to divine juſtice for the ſins of man, paid all our debts, and ſo ſet us free from the curſe.</p>
               <p>This was done two wayes.</p>
               <p>By his perfect obedience,</p>
               <p>By his ſufferings for our guilt.</p>
               <p>Now Jeſus Chriſt did faithfully do both theſe. 1. He did by his righteouſneſſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, perfectly fullfill the Law.</p>
               <p>He did fulfill all Righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
               <p>2. He did faithfully ſuffer, and undergoe all that puniſhment which was due to our ſins. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of both theſe parts of his ſatisfaction, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7, 8. and <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53. 5, 6.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Interceſſion, is that part of Chriſts Prieſtly office, whereby he appeares before the Father, deſiring, that for the perpetuall vertue and merit of his ſacrifice, all his members may find acceptance with God, and may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefit of his obedience and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
               <p>Now this Chriſt faithfully began on earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 5. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. <hi>per totum.</hi> And is faithfully continued ſtill in heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:170411:76"/>
In the opening of this doctrine, I ſhall ſhew you,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſt was faithfull.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why he was ſo.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>That Chriſt was faithfull in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what ſervice was appointed him, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>By the many publicke Testimonies which God gave to him, when he was on earth.</hi> At his Baptiſme, at his Transfiguration. This is my wellbeloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 17. and <hi>Math.</hi> 17. 5. The Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God is according to truth. God would never thus have borne witneſſe to Chriſt, if there had been in him the leaſt unfaithfullneſs. He could not have been ſatisfied and well-pleaſed with him, if there had been the leaſt failure: yea before his incarnation, God beares him witneſſe, <hi>vid. Eſa.</hi> 42. 1. 2. 3. 4.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>By the exaltation of Chriſt to the right hand of God in glory.</hi> He ſhould never have had either Crowne or Throne from God, if he had not faithfully diſcharged every thing which he undertook: for his glorification was upon that condition, that he ſhould faithfully diſcharge every part and parcell of what he undertook, <hi>vid, Eſa.</hi> 53. 12. The Apoſtle ſaith, he was taken from priſon, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53. 8. the priſon of the grave. Jeſus Chriſt could never have riſen out of the grave, the priſon-doores would never have opened, the Jaylor, Death, would never have let his Priſoner out, if he had not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170411:77"/>
performed all, The Heavens would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have opened to him, or given him any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, had he been in the leaſt unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Therefore our Saviour demands his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from God, upon the faithfull diſcharge of his duty, as that which by compact and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was due to him, <hi>vid, Ioh.</hi> 17, 5. When you read that Scripture, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. conclude that <hi>Paul</hi> was faithfull.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>By all thoſe commands which are given by God to all ſinners to beleeve in Chriſt,</hi> And by all thoſe promiſes which God himſelf hath made of acceptance of all thoſe who receive Jeſus Chriſt upon the Termes of the Goſpell. Many commands are given by God. This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, heare him. This is the will of God, that ye ſhould beleeve in him, whom he hath ſent. And for promiſes of acceptance of us in Chriſt, how doth the Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound? <hi>vid. Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. Yea we know that all the Patriarchs before Chriſts incarnation, they were accepted and ſaved by vertue of Chriſts ſatisfaction to be made. God accepted of Chriſts intention. There would have been no ſuch thing as reconciliation between God and man, or ſalvation, if Chriſt had not been faithfull. No promiſes of pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No giving <hi>of the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> if Chriſt had been unfaithfull.</p>

               <p n="1">(1) <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt will open thy heart to underſtand, and believe, and apply thoſe truths which are held out, in, and by the Miniſtry of the Word.</hi> Thou haſt a blind mind, darkneſs clouds thy underſtanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thou wanteſt memory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> well, Chriſt hath undertaken this, as thy Prophet, to teach thy heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to annoint thy eyes, He is able to remove all the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, rudeneſs, intractableneſs, indocibleneſs of thy ſoul, <hi>&amp;c. Vid.</hi> Eſa. 54. 13. He can teach irreſiſtibly, infallibly.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt will teach thee to put a difference between truth and error.</hi> We live in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many falſe lights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are riſen up, many ſeducers gone out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> well, Chriſt is a faithful Prophet. And by vertue of that Office, he hath undertaken <hi>to lead his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into all truth,</hi> John 16. 13. <hi>Ye have an unction,</hi> &amp;c. 1 John 2. 20. Eſa. 30. 21. To <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (if it were poſſible) the very Elect,</hi> that is impoſſible, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 22. For a time, they may go aſtray; but Chriſt their Prophet, will reduce them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They went out from us, becauſe they were not of us,</hi> &amp;c. 1 John 2. 19.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt will at laſt, root out of his Church error, Hereſies, and falſe Doctrines,</hi> &amp;c. This belongs to his Prophetical Office. He hath in all Ages, done ſo. He overthrew Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170411:79"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All thoſe old errors which over-ſpread the face of the Church, in the beginning of the Goſpel, they are all routed and ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Vid. Rev.</hi> 12. 15, 16. They are not the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts in <hi>Germany.</hi> They are not. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We may live in hopes, now Toleration is endeavoured.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt will endue his Miniſters with gifts of teaching,</hi> governing; and that he will preſerve &amp; continue them in his Church, notwithſtanding all the malice of men, and Devils againſt them, <hi>vid. Rev.</hi> 2. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>The Devil hath laboured in all Ages, to rout the Miniſtry. <hi>Chariots and Horſemen,</hi> 2 Reg. 13. 14. <hi>Anteſignani:</hi> all ſhoot at the Colours. <hi>I will ſmite the Shepheard, and the Sheep ſhall be ſcattered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Antichriſt could never yet put out theſe Lamps, Stars, <hi>vid.</hi> Jer. 33. 18, 19, 20. A Goſpel-promiſe.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>For his Kingly Office, comfort ariſeth, in theſe five particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt will ſettle the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church,</hi> He will not ſuffer the Lawes he hath made, the hedge he hath ſet up, to be alwayes demoliſhed, <hi>vid.</hi> Eſa. 54. 11, 12, 13, 14. A Goſpel-promiſe. He will fit men with gifts, and hearts to be Rulers in his Church. Though ſome ſhould fall off, after they have put their hands to the Plough. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 62.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>That he will vanquiſh all the enemies of thy ſoul.</hi> Corruptions, paſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170411:80"/>
enemies, <hi>vid.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. <hi>vid.</hi> 1 John 3. 8.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) That <hi>He will deſtroy all the viſible enemies of his Church.</hi> Antichriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the laſt great enemy, <hi>vid.</hi> Pſal. 2. 9. Pſal. 110. 5. Rev. 8. <hi>init. vid.</hi> Zech. 1. 19. 21. <hi>vid.</hi> Mich. 4. <hi>per totum,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially verſ. 9. 13. Goſpel-promiſe.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) That <hi>He will communicate, and convey into thee, thoſe gifts, graces, which are neceſſary for thee, for all thy Relations.</hi> Of his fulneſs we have all received, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. Jeſus Chriſt is a Feoffee, or Guardian, intruſted with thy Patrimony of grace. He hath no need of thy grace, he hath enough of his own, he will not pocket up any of that which belongs to thee.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) <hi>That he will effectually gather all his ſheep together,</hi> vid. John 10. 16.</p>
               <p>(3) <hi>For his Prieſtly-Office,</hi> much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ariſeth.</p>
               <p>(1) In reference to the ſatisfactory part, thy comfort is,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt hath left nothing upon the ſcore, which God can exact from thee.</hi> All that thou didſt owe to Divine Juſtice, is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcharged. The Law, Satan, Conſcience, can lay nothing to thy charge, <hi>vid.</hi> Rom. 8. 33, 34. Heb. 10. 14. <hi>vid.</hi> Col. 2. 14.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>That thy perſon is accepted through him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) In reference to the Interceſſory part of it, thy comfort is,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>That he will faithfully preſent thy Prayers</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:170411:80"/>
                  <hi>and procure acceptance with God for them, through</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>the ſweetneſs of his incenſe,</hi> though they be rough, harſh, ſmoky in themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) That <hi>He will appear, and ſuffer no plea to faſten againſt thee in Heaven. Satan is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually preferring Inditements and Accuſations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee.</hi> He is <hi>the accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> Rev. 12. 10.</p>
               <p>We may ſee by his ſuggeſtions againſt <hi>Iob,</hi> Cap. 1. 10. Cap. 2. 4.</p>
               <p>As faſt as he brings Accuſations in, ſo faſt doth thy Advocate caſt them out, <hi>vid.</hi> Zech. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. When Satan ſhewes to God, the <hi>filthy Garments</hi> of thy pollution, then doth Chriſt ſhew the glorious Garments of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo non-ſuites Satan preſently, and caſts out the Bill.</p>
               <p>And this thou mayſt the rather be confident of, becauſe he is alwayes preſent in the Court. Nothing can be entered or done, without his knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He lives</hi> for this very work, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
               <p>He is yet in the habit of the High Prieſt, <hi>vid.</hi> Rev. 1. 13. He hath his Robe on him, and his curious Girdle, even now in Heaven. <hi>Steephen</hi> ſees him in his mediatory poſture, ſtanding at the right hand of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 56.</p>
               <p>3d Uſe. <hi>Exhortation.</hi> 1. <hi>That you would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly and fiducially truſt Ieſus Chriſt with all your concernments.</hi> He is able, and beſides, he is faithful. <hi>Caſt all your cares upon him,</hi> and that without wavering, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 7. venture all upon him. It was ſpoken to the Church in

               </list>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>Make that uſe which the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> vid. 1 John 2. 6. Let us be like to him in faithfulneſs, let us be faithful to God, to men, to our ſelves, in all matters of truſt repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in us. It was the honour of Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>Righteouſneſs was the Girdle of his loyns,</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs the Girdle of his reyns,</hi> Eſa. 11. 5. Let us get this Girdle about us: Faithfulneſs is one of Chriſts Names, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 11. Let it be our Name alſo. As we are <hi>Chriſtiani à Chriſto,</hi> ſo let us be <hi>fideles</hi> from him, who is Faithful.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) We are fallen into unfaithful times, <note place="margin">Neceſſity of urging this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine threefold.</note> 
                  <hi>Davids</hi> Complaint may be ours, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 1. or the Prophets complaint, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 5. Every Brother is a ſupplanter. Treachery is one of the laſt dayes ſins, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">(2) We all of us have ſome matter of truſt repoſed in us, ſome way or other, though ſome more then other; yet all in ſome caſe or other, ſome one Talent or other. As we are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170411:81"/>
                  <hi>God</hi> hath truſted us with our ſouls, (a great truſt) life, health, time. As we are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related, ſomething of truſt is committed to us: Miniſters are truſted with peoples ſouls: Magiſtrates, they are truſted with the Lawes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Governours of Families, they are truſted with Children, Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There's no man, but he hath ſome Feoffeſhip or other.

               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) We have all of us, the ſame ſeed of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs, which is manifeſted in any, who do betray their truſt; <hi>Ergo,</hi> treacherous hearts in the beſt.</p>

               <p n="1">(1) Fidelity in diſcharging any Truſt or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, hath theſe three things in it, which makes it up, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>All and every branch, and piece of work belonging to that Office; muſt be done, reſpect muſt be had to every part of the Commiſſion.</hi> Equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Theſe things ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Univerſality in reſpect of the Object of the charge enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170411:82"/>
To inſtance in particulars, A Miniſter that is faithful, muſt deliver the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>God,</hi> Acts 20. 27. He muſt teach every truth, reprove every ſin, confute every error which is crept abroad in the age he lives in: if he <hi>keep back any thing</hi> of that which he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to deliver, he is an unfaithful Miniſter, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
               <p>A Servant who would be faithful, muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form every piece of his Maſters work; if he do one thing, &amp; leave another undone, he proves unfaithful, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 35.</p>
               <p>An Embaſſador that would be faithful, muſt deliver the whole Meſſage of him who ſent him, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
               <p>A Magiſtrate that would be faithful, muſt diſcharge every piece of his Duty.</p>
               <p>An Executor that would be faithful, muſt fulfill the whole will of the Teſtator, pay eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry debt, diſcharge every Legacy, perform every pious and charitable work.</p>
               <p>An Agent or Factor, who would be faithful, muſt obſerve all his inſtructions, pay every peny enjoyned, deliver to him that employed him, every peny he receives.</p>
               <p>An Advocate muſt plead every part of the Cauſe, urge every Argument, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> look how far any part of our taske is omitted willingly, ſo far we fail of fidelity.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>Fidelity muſt have diligence in acting, and exactneſs in fulfilling what is undertaken. All that is done, muſt be done, as well as is poſſible, as ſeaſonably as can be, with all the skill, ſtrength,</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:170411:82"/>
                  <hi>knowledge we have, or can attain to.</hi> A Miniſter that is faithful, muſt not only preach every truth, confute every error, reprove every ſin, but he muſt do it convincingly, as powerfully, as fully as he can. A Servant muſt do his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters work, as carefully, perfectly as he can. To this purpoſe is required, a very diligent uſe of all meanes, helps to fit a perſon for his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment undertaken, that he may be able to mannage it, with all exactneſs and dexterity. <hi>vid. Gen.</hi> 24. 33. <hi>He would not eat, till he had delivered his Embaſſage.</hi> So <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 31. 6. and verſ. 40. Let him who hath an Office, <hi>wait</hi> upon his Office, <hi>vid.</hi> Rom. 12. 7, 8. A man may be as guilty of an unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a careleſs and negligent doing, as in a total and careleſs omiſſion. As good never a whit, as never the better, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 20. 33. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23. Faithfulneſs is ſet out by diligence, we have often proved diligent in many things.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>All that which is done, muſt be done out of a ſincere reſpect and love to him that hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, and to thoſe for whom we are intruſted and employed.</hi> Self-ſeeking and faithfulneſs have no agreement, they are not conſiſtent. If an Embaſſador diſcharge all his truſt, and that with all exactneſs, yet if he aim not at the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of him who ſent him, but at his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he is not a faithful Embaſſador. If a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter be exact, in diſcharging his whole truſt, yet if he aym at his own applauſe, profit, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and not at <hi>Gods</hi> honour, and the peoples good, he is not faithful. If <hi>Iob</hi> had kept the Crown of <hi>Rabbah</hi> to himſelf, and had not put it on
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170411:83"/>
                  <hi>Davids</hi> head, he had been an unfaithful Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: therefore he ſends to <hi>David,</hi> to come and take the Crown, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 26, 27, 28. If <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> Servant, when he had uſed all his skill to get <hi>Rebeckahs</hi> conſent, had kept her for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not brought her to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he had been an unfaithful Servant. In this only, <hi>Jehu</hi> fails of faithfulneſs: he did every thing which <hi>God</hi> had commanded, and he uſed much exactneſs and diligence in doing it; but he acted not for <hi>Gods</hi> honour, but for his own greatneſs, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 10. 16. He pretended to act for <hi>God,</hi> but it was really for himſelf. If an Advocate ſhould be diligent in pleading for his Client, and when he hath done, ſhould keep the Inheritance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to himſelf, he would be a treacherous man. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſhewes his fidelity in this, he had been a careful Preacher, had converted many ſouls, but he ſurrenders them all to Chriſt, and that when the people had ſo good an opinion of him, as that they would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to him, rather then to Chriſt, <hi>vid. Joh.</hi> 3. 26, 28, 29. And ſo our Saviour teſtifies his own Faithfulneſs. <hi>I ſeek not my own glory, but the glory of him that ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a Servant ſhould toyle and ſweat about the ſowing of his Maſters ground, and the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of it in, and then ſhould ſell it for himſelf, and keep his Maſter out of poſſeſſion, would this be faithfullneſſe? If Souldiers ſent out to ſubdue a City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Should lay a hard ſiege to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and after all ſhould keep it as their own, would you call this faithfullneſſe?
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170411:83"/>
would it not be Treachery, perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</p>
               <p>Thus for the requiſites of faithfullneſſe,</p>
               <p n="2">(2) By way of motive, much may be ſaid, conſider. (1) The excellency of fidelity, (1) <hi>Its a very glorious vertue in it ſelfe, in its own Nature.</hi> Its reckoned by our Saviour amongſt <hi>the great matters of the Law of God.</hi> vid. Math. 23. 23. <hi>By faith</hi> is meant <hi>fidelity.</hi> It hath one of the higheſt Thrones amongſt Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues <note place="margin">Magnalia Legis.</note> and graces. Juſtice is ſaid to be the Queen or Foundreſſe of all other vertues. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in diſcharging truſt, is no ſmall piece of Juſtice and Righteouſneſſe. The Law of Juſtice is violated, when fidelity is nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: there are <hi>Righteouſneſſe and faithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> put together very often, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11. 5. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 19. 20. A man cannot be juſt, unleſſe he be faithfull. (2) Its excellent in the uſe of it. <hi>It is one of the great bonds of humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie;</hi> fidelity is as the very nerves and ſinews of all ſocieties, by which they are tied and kept together. Tis the ground of all commerce between man &amp; man, Nation &amp; Nation, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Kingdome. If you untie this knot, if you cut this ſinew, there is nothing but broyles, contentions, fires, ſtrifes, diſſentions in the world; unfaithfullneſſe doth diſſolve and disjoynt all humane ſocieties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 2. <hi>Conſider the many promiſes made unto faithfulnes,</hi> the great reward which are deſigned and ſet apart for it. (1) God hath promiſed

                  </gap> a man who carefully fulfills every kind of engagement, and is true to every truſt he ſhall abound with bleſſings in this life, he is right heire to all the bleſſings of God. <hi>Solomon</hi> in theſe heavenly Proverbs, croſſeth the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Proverbs uſed amongſt men.

(2) <hi>To teſtify his great love and kindneſſe to the ſons of men,</hi> how unwilling he was that ſin ſhould be their ruine: he did beare a great good will to the whole Nature which he had aſſumed, it was a trouble to him to ſee that any miſery ſhould befall them. Therefore he forgives them, and prayes the Father to do ſo likewiſe, it was an act of compaſſion. Pitty moved him to it<hi>:</hi> He looked upon them as a company of ignorant people that were doing they knew not what; and his ſoul is troubled for them. Therefore he deſires it might not be imputed.</p>

(5) <hi>To ſhew the willingneſs of his death, he ſuffered without the leaſt regret.</hi> He had not ſo much as the leaſt grudge in his heart, againſt thoſe, who cauſed his Death; he could embrace them in the arms of love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Had he died involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, he would never have paſſed by the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of his Death ſo freely.</p>

                  </gap>e for whom he intercedes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> We read, that many of thoſe who were guilty of Chriſts Death, were afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and ſaved by that blood they ſhed, as hath been ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. 41. and is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. But that all thoſe who were guilty of his blood, were forgiven; we have no reaſon to think, yea, the Scripture hints the contrary. And yet the mediatorious Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not in vain to any, for whom tis made,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170411:92"/>
but all ſuch for whom he intercedes as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Divines do very well diſtinguiſh of the Prayers of Chriſt. There are two ſorts of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which Chriſt made.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which he made <hi>Ex officio mediatoris,</hi> as he was <hi>Advocate,</hi> and <hi>Mediator</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Grace,</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> ſuch is that Prayer which is recorded, <hi>John</hi> 17. Cap. that Prayer was inſtituted by Chriſt, in order to his mediatory Office; And all thoſe for whom he thus intercedes, ſhall certainly be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which Chriſt made <hi>Ex Officio homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis privati.</hi> Now this prayer in the Text, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to this latter ſort, where Chriſt, as a man made under the Law, prayed for his enemies, as other of the Servants of God have done. Such was that Prayer which Chriſt made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Death, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſſe from me,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 26. 39. 42. 44.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Uſe.</hi> I ſhall <hi>only make this one uſe of it,</hi> viz. <hi>That we would all learn to imitate our Saviour in this grace,</hi> vid. 1 John 2. 6. He that <hi>ſaith he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in him, ought himſelf ſo to walk as Chriſt walked.</hi> Tis a very difficult and hard Leſſon, but it is a very glorious Leſſon, to be willing to forgive them, who have done us injuries—Did Chriſt paſſe by ſuch an Act as this, and wilt not thou?</p>

the hands of the Magiſtrate?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Yes certainly, The Servants of God have done ſo, and not blamed for it, <hi>vid.</hi> Luk. 18. 3. And Magiſtracy is an Ordinance of <hi>God</hi> for this purpoſe, <hi>vid.</hi> Rom. 13. 4. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. verſ. 1. only we muſt carefully obſerve theſe Rules in ſuch caſes, <hi>viz.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This Remedy muſt be made uſe of at laſt, not ſo much for the ſatisfying of our private wrongs, as for other publick ends,</hi> as</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God may receive honour.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Nor doth this hinder the publike juſtice of the Magiſtrate againſt others.</p>
               <p>So in lawful Warre, a man may kill his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and yet forgive him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a man may lawfully demand his debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 4. 7. But from this Example of Chriſt, we are bound to forgive our enemies, ſo far forth, as juſtice may not be prejudiced, or offendors be not encouraged.

               <p>I would give (1) Some Motives.</p>
               <p>(2) Some helps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 1. <hi>Many of the Servants of God, have attained to a very great meaſure of this grace. Stephen</hi> the <hi>Protomartyr,</hi> the firſt that followed his Maſter this way, died with a Prayer in his mouth, for the pardoning of his Perſecutors, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 60. He ſuffered very <hi>innocently,</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>cruelly,</hi> and yet he freely forgave them, while they were caſting ſtones at him, he was caſting up prayers for them; he was pouring out peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while they were powring out his guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs blood. <hi>Moſes,</hi> he forgives <hi>Miriam,</hi> and when the hand of <hi>God</hi> was broken forth upon her for his ſake, he begs for a playſter, Heal her now O Lord, I beſeech thee, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> he forgives his Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 17. 21. and ſhewes much compaſſion to them. <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> he forgives the injurious dealing of <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus,</hi> upon the intreaty of <hi>Paul</hi> and his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Theſe are rare examples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 2. <hi>This is one of the higheſt Acts of Christianity. And it is one of the best evidences that our ſins are forgiven of God,</hi> vid. Mat. 6. 12. <hi>forgive us as we forgive.</hi> Our forgiving of wrongs is not indeed a <hi>Cauſe</hi> of Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving us; There's no <hi>Cauſe</hi> of forgiveneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Gods mercy,</hi> and <hi>Christs merit,</hi> but its a ſure fruit and conſequence of it. Its a Teſtimony, that God hath been, and will be very indulgent to our offences, if we finde this diſpoſition in our hearts: and while we retain rancor, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170411:93"/>
in our ſpirits towards others, we can have no confidence or aſſurance to think, that God will be propitious to us, <hi>vid.</hi> Mat. 18. 23. <hi>ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 3. <hi>Tis the way to melt and mollifie the hearts of injurious dealers.</hi> A ſoft tongue break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the bone, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 15. A hard flint is ſooner broken upon a ſoft Cuſhion, then upon a hard Marble, <hi>vid.</hi> Rom. 12. 20, 21. This is Gods way of overcoming a wrong Doer. <hi>Davids</hi> forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Saul,</hi> melted his rocky heart, Thou art more righteous then I, and he wept over him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 4. <hi>The peaceableneſs and calmneſs which followes in a mans ſpirit, that is able to forgive.</hi> Your forgiving Chriſtians, are the quieteſt Chriſtians. Endeavours of revenge, they torment the ſoul, heat and boyl the heart many times more then the injury received. When a man ſhall be ſtudying how to ſatisfie his fury, the very gathering together, and ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening theſe ſtones of Revenge, they make more deep wounds in the ſpirit, then 1000. offences received.—The envious, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful man, troubles his own fleſh. <hi>Injuria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum remedium oblivio.</hi> He that hath but learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perfectly this Leſſon of forgiving, hath a ſalve againſt the greateſt injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 5. <hi>Tis a very honourable frame of heart.</hi> He that can thus <hi>overcome his own ſpirit, is better then he that overcommeth a City.</hi> You know him of whom it is ſaid, <hi>That he never forgat any thing but injuries.</hi>

               <p>IN this Chapter, we have a great miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cure, wrought by our Saviour, upon a man, who had a withered hand. We may take notice of four things in this ſtory,</p>

               <p n="2">(2) <hi>The time when,</hi> on the Sabbath-day.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>The Cure, and the manner of it,</hi> he only ſpake the word, and it was healed.</p>

1. On their parts, we may obſerve theſe two things.</p>

               <p n="2">(2) On Chriſts part, we may note theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. His expoſtulation with them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the lawfulneſs of this matter, verſ. 4. which is further amplified by a like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 11.

               <p>In the words I have read, we have theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) The ſinful malady and diſtemper of the Jewes, hardneſs of heart, <gap reason="foreign">

This hard skin is ſpread over the ſouls of all men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. This is an hereditary Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Uſe.</hi> This ſhewes the reaſon, why the preaching of the Word, and all the Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of grace, are ſo ineffectual, and do ſo little good upon the hearts of moſt men: why there are ſo few converted and brought home to God: the heart is hard, hard by nature, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened more by Cuſtom in ſinning.

               <p>2d <hi>Uſe.</hi> The Miniſters of God ſhould, from hence, learn to uſe all their might and skill, in diſpenſing the word of Gods grace to the Sons of men.

As he was moved often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſorrow, becauſe of the poenal evils of men; ſo was he moved to grief, becauſe of their ſinful evils.

He had no ſinful venome within, nor was ever guilty of the leaſt ſinful Imagination, word, or thought, yet could his heart break within him, to behold the woful miſcarriages of others.

Therefore did his heart bleed within him, when he ſaw men do any thing which would ruine their ſouls. Theſe Jewes did not know what the ſad conſequence of their malicious hardneſs againſt Jeſus Chriſt would be, but Chriſt knew whereto it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily tend, to the deſtroying of that Jewel, in compariſon of which, all the World was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy: therefore he mourned for them.

hath a great influence upon others, to make them mourn. They muſt needs think, that there was ſomething more then ordinary, in ſin, which did ſo affect the heart of Jeſus Chriſt. Our Saviour had a deſign upon them, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade with them, to look more narrowly into the Nature of ſin, than they did before. The teares which Chriſt ſhed for ſin, doth diſcover the odiouſneſs of it, as much as any thing.

               <p>I ſhall firſt handle the grace it ſelf by way of Doctrine. And then enforce the imitation of it, in the application.</p>
               <p>The doctrine is this, That Jeſus Chriſt did not pleaſe himſelf. Nothing was more remote from Jeſus Chriſt, while he was upon the earth, then ſelf-ſeeking and ſelf-pleaſing. This we ſhall find made good two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) By his profeſſions. He doth many times publikely profeſſe againſt ſelf-pleaſing, &amp; ſelf-ſeeking; And we are ſure that his Teſtimony is true. Mens bare expreſſions, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themſelves, are not valuable. Their tongues and hearts many times are contrary<hi>:</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt, neither did any ſin, nor <hi>had any guile found in his lips,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. he was not acquainted with fraudulency; nothing but truth lay in his heart, and nothing but truth came out of his lips, therefore we may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, yea we muſt ſubſcribe to his Teſtimony.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170411:106"/>
his words. Men they often profeſſe againſt ſelf-pleaſing; that they my pleaſe themſelves more ſecurely: ſelf-denying, votes make but more way for ſelf-ſeeking practiſes, but Chriſt did not onely profeſſe ſelf-denyall, but practiſe it, we ſhall find ſelf-denyall written upon all his actions—. Self-detriment and ſelf-loſſe, and ſelf-ſhame, was all which Jeſus Chriſt gained.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) In taking our nature upon him, he loſt his glory; the beauty and brightneſſe of the Divine nature, was ſhadowed and hid under the rags of our fleſh, the aſhes of the humane fleſh did obſcure the ſhining beames of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>he emptied himſelfe,</hi> Phil. 2. 7, 8. <hi>he made himſelf of no reputation,</hi>

               <p n="1">(1) He denyed his own eaſe, his life was full of labour, watchfullneſſe, painfulneſſe, wearineſſe.</p>

               <p n="3">(3) He ſought not his own profit, he had no lands, no houſes, no revenues: <hi>Foxes have holes, the birds of the ayre have nests, the Son of man hath not where to lay his head,</hi> he was <gap reason="foreign">

If you trace him from his birth to his grave, you ſhall find nothing that can be called ſelf-pleaſing, or ſelf-ſeeking. All he acted, all he did was out of reſpect to others: he was borne for others, he laboured, he wept, he preached, he prayed, he lived, he dyed, not for himſelf, but for others.</p>
               <p>He might have had all the honours, glory, preferment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the world could afford, but he ſought none of theſe things, he would leave any thing of ſelf-concernment, when he had opportunity to do others good.</p>

Now Servants are <hi>not to ſeek themſelves,</hi> but them for whom they are employed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted. This is the reaſon which the Apoſtle gives for this very thing, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 4, 5. 7. he ſpeaks, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. how Chriſt <hi>looked not at his own things,</hi> &amp;c. and the reaſon is hinted, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. he <hi>took upon him the forme of a Servant.</hi> And this is the very reaſon which he gives his Diſciples of that ſelf-neglect, which they ſaw in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 34. my meate is to do the will of <hi>him that ſent me,</hi> and <hi>to finiſh his work.</hi> Chriſt in his word, requires of all Servants, that they look not at what is of advantage to themſelves, but at what may be for the benefit of thoſe that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 9.</note> have choſen them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Even Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; they muſt pleaſe them, who have choſen them, not themſelves.</hi> And having taken upon him the office of a Servant, he would act as became a Servant, <hi>vid. Joh.</hi> 6. 38.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>From the ſtrength and Ardency of the affection which he bare to the glory of God, and the good of men.</hi> The honour of his Father was precious to him, the advantaging of his Church was the delight of his Soul. He could neither have brought glory to his Father, nor been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to men, if <hi>he had pleaſed himſelf and ſought himſelf,</hi> therefore he looks off himſelf, and looks to others. The ſeeking of himſelfe would have been the loſing of the world; the pleaſing of himſelf would have been the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of others; his eaſe would have been his Churches torment, his pleaſure would have been their paine, <hi>&amp;c. Paul</hi> he was ſo far in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170411:108"/>
love with the Churches good, that he can be content to neglect himſelf, for their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, <hi>vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10. if ſelf and Church ſtood in competition, as many times they did, he would diſpleaſe ſelf to pleaſe the Church. The love of Chriſt is ſtronger then the love of 10000 <hi>Pauls.—</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>That he might teach us the ſinfulneſſe and danger of the ſin of ſelf-pleaſing and prevent us from falling into it,</hi> what the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the patient ſuffering of Chriſt, we may ſay alſo of this, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. Therefore we find that when the Apoſtles endeavour to take off Chriſtians, from this they ordinarily urge the example of Chriſt. As there are two wayes, whereby the excellency of duty appeares, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods command and Chriſts example; ſo there are alſo two wayes whereby the evill of ſin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, <hi>viz.</hi> the prohibition of Gods law, and the care of Chriſt in declining it.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) <hi>From that humanity, curteſy, and comity, which was in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> where there is ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of nature, there will not be ſelf-pleaſing, uſually ſelf-pleaſing is found in moroſe, rugged, harſh natures; ſuch as <hi>Nabal</hi> was.</p>
               <p>But Nature in Jeſus Chriſt was in its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The Scripture makes mention of the <hi>grace</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>i. e.</hi> the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his diſpoſition. There was no ſoureneſs of nature in our Saviour. Grace is powred into thy lips, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) <hi>Our Saviour knew well that the end of his coming into the world, was of publique, not of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:170411:108"/>
                  <hi>and perſonall concernment,</hi> therefore his deſire was to pleaſe, to ſeek others not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The wiſedome and happineſſe of men is to <hi>know</hi> their <hi>end,</hi> and to <hi>ſerve</hi> their <hi>end;</hi> our Saviour had this wiſedome, we ſhall find him very often arguing in divers caſes, from the end of his coming into the world. <hi>I came not to do my own will, Io.</hi> 6. 38.</p>
               <p>1. Uſe. Information.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) We may from hence take notice of the very great humility of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he was ſo lowly and ſo full of condeſcenſion, that he would ſtoope to the meaneſt of the ſons of men. Though he was the <hi>excellent glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> yet he did not ſo far inſiſt upon his own greatneſſe, as to the diſregard, and overlook the concernments of others; He did undervalue and paſſe over (as I may ſay) the things of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall concernment, that he might take care of the things of others. Great men they think it too far below themſelves, to take into their thoughts the things of others, to look to them in their actings, &amp;c. they judge it a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but Jeſus Chriſt did not ſo. If they may pleaſe, profit, advantage themſelves, they mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not though many be ruin'd, undone, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,—Jeſus Chriſt was of another mind; He would not do any thing, which might ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize anorher, though he might have done it: he <hi>payed tribute</hi> to avoid ſcandalizing of others, <hi>Math.</hi> 17. 27,</p>
               <p n="2">(2) We may from hence ſee the reaſon of ſeverall Acts of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>(1) Why it was that our Lord Jeſus did
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170411:109"/>
ſo contentedly paſſe by and diſregard all the indignities, all the hard uſage he receives from men, ſometimes he was called <hi>Beelzebub</hi> a <hi>Samaritan, and, hath a Devill a Wine bibber, and riotous perſon,</hi> yet we do not read that he was much moved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when he was <hi>reviled, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled not againe,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23. The cauſe is, <hi>He did not pleaſe himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1) It lets us ſee the reaſon alſo why he was ſo little taken with popular applauſe. The <hi>Euges, Hoſannas</hi> of men did not much affect him, when he had wrought great miracles, to noyſe his fame, he would retire into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, he acted his greateſt works often in corners, When his brethren importune him to take a publike ſtage to act upon, he ſlights them, <hi>&amp;c. Joh.</hi> 7. 4. he rejects it.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Why his converſe was with men of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt condition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he came as readily to the poore Cottage, as to the Centurion's houſe.</p>

               <p>A Receipt of ſeven Ingredients.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Take heed of Pride and Vain glory. As ſelf-ſeeking ingenders pride, ſo pride doth much foment and nouriſh this ſin of ſelf-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Humility makes men ſtoop to others, and take their good into conſideration; but pride faſtens a mans eyes only upon himſelf. A proud man ſcorns all others, and all others
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170411:113"/>
ſcorn him. Where there is moſt condeſcenſion, and humility, there will be the leaſt ſelf-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. The Apoſtle preſcribes the Phyſick of Humility, to prevent the Diſeaſe of ſelf-pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where it is not; and to cure it, where it is, <hi>vid,</hi> Phil. 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>In the 4th Verſe, we have the duty enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Look not every man on his own things,</hi> &amp;c. in the 3d Verſe, he doth <hi>removere prohibens, Let nothing be done through ſtrife and vain glory, &amp;c.</hi> Could we but think meanly of our ſelves, and highly of others, we would pleaſe others though by our own diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Beg for, and labour to attain unto a very great meaſure of Brotherly love. Self-love is the breeder of ſelf-pleaſing; and want of brotherly love, is the riſe of brother-neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The truth is, uncharitableneſs is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſelf-pleaſing; you muſt dry up the Fountain, if you would have the ſtreams to ceaſe. Were there more love, there would be leſſe ſelf-pleaſing. The Apoſtle deſcribing the Nature of Charity, makes this one property of it, <gap reason="foreign">

It hath two eyes, one for it ſelf, another for the Brethren: if it work with one hand for it ſelf, it works for the Brethren with the other; yea, it will go naked it ſelf, rather then pluck the covering from off others. Self-ſeeking is ſo ſcalding hot in our dayes, becauſe brotherly love and charity are ſo Icy-cold.</p>

(3) <hi>Often read over, and think upon that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Rule of our Saviour, whatſoever ye would, that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them,</hi> Mat. 7. 12. Its a very equitable, and a very compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Rule. The remembring and obſerving of this one Rule, would ſufficiently help us to diſcharge all the Duties of the 2d Table, if there were no more ſaid of them. There's not a man upon Earth, but would have his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments cared for by others; he would have himſelf, and his affaires, taken into thought by others: how unreaſonable and unjuſt is it then, that any man ſhould only ſeek, and act for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when as he would have no other to do ſo?</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Conſider often of the Union and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction there is between thee and others.

               </p>
               <p n="5">(5) <hi>Often think of the meaneſs of ſelf,</hi> what a low, unworthy, and mean end he propounds, who confines his care, thoughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only within the narrow compaſſe of Self.

And in this Chapter we have the accompliſhment of this prophecy. Jeſus Chriſt, as was foretold, beginning his propheticall office, comes to purge his Temple of thoſe corruptions, which
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170411:116"/>
through the ignorance and profaneneſſe of the people, and the covetouſneſſe of the Prieſts and Scribes had been introduced and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that place.</p>
               <p>In the Chapter we have two great mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) The <hi>turning of water into wine at a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-feaſt in</hi> Cana <hi>of</hi> Galile, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>ad</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The reforming and purging out of the abuſes of the Temple, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>ad finem.</hi> It is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jerome in Math.</hi> 21. 12.</note> the opinion of <hi>Jerome,</hi> that this was (all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conſidered) one of the greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which Chriſt wrought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Multi arbitrantur maxima eſſe ſignorum quod Lazarus ſuſcitatus eſt, quòd caecus ex utero lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men accepit, quòd transfiguratus in monte glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am oſtendit triumphantis: mihi autem inter omnia ſigna quae fecit Dominus, hoc videtur eſſe mirabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, quòd unus homo, &amp; illo tempore contemptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, &amp; in tantum vilis ut poſtea crucifigeretur, Scribis &amp; Phariſaeis contra ſe ſaevientibus &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentibus lucra ſua deſtrui, potuerit ad unius fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelli verbera tantam eijcere multitudinem, menſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que avertere, &amp; confringere cathedras, &amp; talia facere quae infinitus non feciſſet exercitus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were at that time a very great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people come from all parts to obſerve the Paſſeover. The Scribes, Prieſts, and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees were ſufficiently enraged againſt Chriſt, and the Tower called <hi>Arx Antonia,</hi> wherein were the Souldiers of the Temple, was neere at hand; and yet that no man ſhould dare to oppoſe Chriſt in this act; that one man under
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170411:116"/>
tempt and ſcorne, not with ſword and armes, but with a whip made of ſmall cords, which they who brought Sheep and Oxen, had laid there for their uſe, ſhould drive ſo many out of the Temple, and not one of the Merchants or people, ſo much as ſpeake a word in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this is miraculous, and more then prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</p>
               <p>In this miracle we have theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The miracle it ſelfe<hi>:</hi> in which,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) The time when. A little before the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh paſſeover, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The place where: the Temple. Not that part of it, into which the Prieſts onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, but the <hi>Atrium,</hi> or outward Court, in which the people prayed, were taught, and offered ſacrifices, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) The occaſon of this miracle, this is <hi>ver.</hi> 14. The original of this cuſtome, is from that which is written, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 24. The Jewes were at this time ſcattered throughout almoſt all Nations, now that they might not at their repairing to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for worſhip, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to run up and downe to provide ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, it was agreed by the Prieſts and Scribes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that thoſe things which were neceſſary for ſacrifice, ſhould be ſold about the Temple—.This was their pretence, but that which really cauſed this, was the covetuouſneſſe of the Prieſts, who made great gaine by theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizings.</p>

(5) The reaſon rendred, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. make not my Fathers houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Temple was a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and type of thoſe things, the lively Image whereof is in Chriſt; therefore it was to be applyed onely to ſpirituall uſes, for this reaſon our Saviour denyes it to be lawfull to convert it to ſuch a common uſe as a Market place.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The effect or conſequence of this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The effect it wrought upon the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. Not that they preſently remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred this; but afterwards when they had been better inſtructed, then God brought this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to their minds, as the reaſon of this act of Chriſt; with which they were ſatisfied.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The effect it wrought upon the Jewes: this is twofold.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Some quarreld with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

The Text is the effect which this great Heroick act of Chriſt wrought on his Diſciples. They remembred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Scripture is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 9. where <hi>David</hi> writing of himſelfe as a Type of Chriſt hath theſe words, <hi>The zeale,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>In them we have two things.</p>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170411:118"/>
as if he had had fire in his bowels, he could not refrain himſelf. The Leſſon which we may learn, is this,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ, was exceeding zealous</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
                  <hi>againſt all manner of Corruptions and defilements in Religion, &amp; in the worſhip of God.</hi> He had in his breaſt a very hot zeal for his Fathers houſe, and all the Ordinances and Services thereof.

               <p>There are three things, wherein Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted <note place="margin">

                  </note> his zeal this way. (1) He did very zealouſly aſſert the purity of Religion and Gods worſhip, in his publick Miniſtry, and zealouſly defend it againſt the corrupters of it. In the 5th 6th and 7th Chapters of <hi>Matth.</hi> in that excellent Sermon upon the Mount, we ſhall finde many Inſtructions given by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, both concerning matters of Doctrine, and concerning matters of worſhip, as Chap. 5. verſ. 21. <hi>ad finem,</hi> and Chapter 6. concerning prayer, faſting: <hi>vid.</hi> Chap. 6. v. 5. ad 16. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning prayer: and v. 16. ad 19. concerning the right manner of faſting.

And <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 3. ad 10. preacheth againſt the Doctrine of Divorce, which they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced. And Chap. 22. v. 23. he cleares the

Doctrine of the Reſurrection againſt the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces. And he that reads ſeriouſly the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, will finde, that there was no corruption, either in Doctrine, or worſhip, but Chriſt boldly, and zealouſly refuted it in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>As he had zeal to reprove, ſo he had zeal to reform the corruptions which he had reproved.</hi> We read of two ſolemn Reformations of things amiſſe, in the worſhip of God, which Chriſt made with his own hands. One we have in the Text. Another we read of <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 12, 13. They are two ſeveral ſtories. This is <hi>John</hi> was done in his entrance, upon his Prophetical and Kingly Office, as appeares <hi>John</hi> 2. 11. That in <hi>Matth.</hi> was towards the end of his life. In this of <hi>John,</hi> Chriſt drave only the ſellers out; but in that of <hi>Matth.</hi> he proceeded farther, and caſt out both them that ſold, and them that bought. Here in <hi>John,</hi> our Saviour ſpeaks only of the deceit of their Merchandize; but there in <hi>Mat.</hi> he ſpeaks of a <hi>Den.</hi> of <hi>Theeves.</hi> Firſt, he rebukes them mildly, then afterwards more ſeverely, ſo that twice Chriſt took this work into his own hand.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>His zeal for the worſhip of God, will appear by his care in the inſtitution of Goſpel-worſhip,</hi> when he had aboliſhed the Jewiſh, <hi>vid.</hi> Mat. 28. 19. 20. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26, 27. And <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 3. thoſe 40. dayes which he ſpent in the World, after his Reſurrection, were paſſed in giving them order about worſhip, and other matters of the Church.

               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>This proceeded from that love, and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reſpect he bore to his Father.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, by which God is more diſhonoured, then by corruptions in worſhip. The Name of God is in his worſhip; and the ſoyling of Gods worſhip, is the defiling of his Name. Now Gods honour was very dear to Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his zeal burned within him, to ſee ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe done to his Father. This is that which is

in the verſe before the Text, verſ. 16. <hi>Make not my Fathers Houſe, an houſe of Merchandize.</hi> The Temple was the Houſe of God, the place of his reſt, the place where he had ſet his Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was the Court of God upon Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore was our Saviour ſo offended, to ſee it polluted.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>From that love and affection he bore to Religion, and to the worſhip of God.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ſaw a great Beauty in the holy Inſtitutions of God in the Church.

It is now many years, ſince we engaged our ſelves in a work of Reformation: where the work hath ſtuck, and ſtill ſticks, the God of Heaven knowes very well; for he can ſee clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, through all the masks which the Sons of men ſhall put upon their faces, who have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſweeping out of corrupt and noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Doctrines, and who have impeded the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of falſe Worſhips, and ſetling the true. And the Lord Jeſus hath not loſt one ſpark of his zeal, by aſcending into Heaven. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It belongs as much to him now, as it did while he was on Earth: he hath not laid aſide any of thoſe Offices which he had, when he was upon Earth. He is ſtill <hi>Prophet,</hi> and he is ſtill <hi>King.</hi> He cannot be depoſed, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned from his Regency and Kingſhip over the Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>per totum.</hi> What charge he had on Earth, he hath ſtill in Heaven.</p>

2. His love to his Father, is not any thing abated: his affections are ſtill, within him, burning and boyling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor is his love to the worſhip of God, and Religion cooled: the worſhip of God, and the truth of Religion, is ſtill as precious to him, as ever it was on Earth.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Nor are his bowels ſtraitned in the leaſt meaſure, towards his Servants on Earth. He is ſtill as ſenſible of their mournings for the corruption of worſhip, and the defilement of Ordinances, as ever he was. And he is as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of their edification, as when he was on Earth.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons of his former zeal continue, and therefore his zeal alſo continueth.</p>
               <p>And beſides all this, he hath given us many promiſes, which he will never break, that his worſhip in the Goſpel Church, ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in purity, <hi>vid.</hi> Eſa. 9. 7.

               <p>Therefore lift up your heads, O ye mournful Sons of <hi>Zion</hi> to whom the preſent corruptions in the Church are a burden, Chriſt will at laſt free you from this burthen.</p>
               <p>And let it not ſeem the leſſe poſſible, or feiſible, becauſe of the ſmall power that is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the Churches part, or for the great viſible power that oppoſeth it.

They will not much diſpute againſt Religion; neither will they contend for it with any great life: the preſence of Religion is no great burden to them, and the want of it is no great loſſe. They will not repine, if they have the Ark, and they will not be greatly offended if they have it not; if the Ordinances of God be in the Temple, tis well; and if the buyers and ſellers there be, tis not much amiſſe. They ſtand in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> as to theſe matters: if Religion dwell in their Coaſts, they will not thruſt it out of doors, and if it be removing, they will not lament after it, nor beg its continuance. They are affected with theſe matters, as
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170411:122"/>
ſome men are with their ordinary friends; if they will ſtay with them, they will not bid them be gone; and if they have a minde to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, they will not deſire their ſtay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>They are concerning Religion of that minde, which <hi>Paul</hi> commands, believing Husbands to be of, towards their unbelieving Wives, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 13. 15. If ſhe be pleaſed to dwell with him, let him not put her away; but if ſhe will depart, let her depart: ſo they ſay, and ſo they act concerning Religion, and the Ordinances of God.</p>
               <p>I have a few things to ſay to ſuch. They are not like the <hi>Gaderenes, Matth.</hi> 8. 34. Nor are they like the two Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 29.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Certainly, they are not acted by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus Chriſt: his was a fiery Spirit, but theirs is a cold Spirit; he had life, they are dead.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath threatned, that he will ſpue ſuch luke-warm Chriſtians out of his mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 15, 16. They are juſt between Heaven and Hell.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170411:122"/>
Some are very zealous for ſuperſtition: the Traditions of their Fathers. Unſawful and unwarranted Ceremonies, and ſinful Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men in the worſhip of God: ſuch was <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and his Aſſociates, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 24. He was as hot for the golden ſhrines for <hi>Diana</hi> as if they had been the golden Plates of the Temple. <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi> Such were thoſe old Idolaters, with whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> had to do, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 16, 17. We will do as we have done, <hi>We and our Fathers, to burn incenſe to the Queen of Heaven.</hi> They are grieved to ſee any endeavour to purge the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Sanctuary from defilements.</p>
               <p>Others are zealous for errors in Doctrine. They would have an unlimited Toleration of all opinions, and all kindes of worſhip in the Church of God. The Woman <hi>Jezebel</hi> ſhall have liberty to vent her falſehoods, as well as the Prophets of God to preach their Truths. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhall have his Throne as well as Chriſt. Altars ſhall be ſet up <hi>to the unknown God,</hi> as well as to the true <hi>God:</hi> the Miniſters of Satan, ſhall keep as free Markets as the Miniſters of Chriſt: the envious man ſhall have Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room to ſcatter his Tares, as well as the Seedſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Goſpel their wheat. And if any of the Miniſters of Chriſt, out of zeal to <hi>Gods</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, endeavour to whip out theſe abuſes out of the Temple, they are looked upon as fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands, Incendiaries, by them who are the true Incendiaries. They are reputed worſe then Theeves, becauſe they diſturb this Den of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170411:123"/>
Theeves, from neſting in the Temple of <hi>God.</hi> They are looked upon as abominable, becauſe they would ſweep out theſe abominations, They are thought unworthy to have a liberty in the Kingdom, becauſe they will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a liberty to all theſe falſe wayes in the Church, the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This zeal is certainly none of that which was in Chriſt. It is Diabolical zeal, like the unruly Tongue, ſet on fire of Hell, <hi>James</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt <hi>whipt the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple;</hi> and theſe laſh ſuch as would whip them out. Jeſus Chriſt was ſore diſpleaſed with the <hi>Angel of Thyatira,</hi> for ſuffering ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 20. and they are diſpleaſed with the Angels of the Churches, becauſe they will not tolerate ſuch corruptions. Jeſus Chriſt would not have any <hi>bid God ſpeed</hi> to ſuch, 2 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. <hi>John</hi> 10: and they would have ſuch em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and encouraged. Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, the mouthes of ſuch as teach falſe Doctrines, muſt be ſtopped, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 11. And they are ready to ſtop the mouthes of ſuch as would have theſe diſturbed. Jeſus Chriſt layes a Command upon Miniſters and Magiſtrates, to apprehend theſe Foxes; but they lay ſnares for ſuch as would have them apprehended, <hi>vid.</hi> Cant. 2. 15. <hi>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes, &amp;c.</hi>

Nor are only the greater and the worſer ſort of Foxes to be taken; but even the little Foxes, the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort of errors, falſe Teachers, which alſo do much ſpoyl in the Church. And yet theſe men would have the Foxes nouriſhed.

               <p>And yet theſe men have the impudence, as to repute themſelves the chief Patrons, if not the only friends of Religion, and are diſpleaſed with thoſe, who account them otherwiſe. <hi>But wiſdom is justified of her Children.</hi> If they be the

               <p>Is he a friend to his Patient, who knowing him to be full of mortal Diſeaſes, will ſuffer no effectual meanes to be uſed, which may remove them? then are theſe men friends to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Is he a Friend to his Garden, who plucks up the hedge, and proclaims liberty to all kinde of wilde Beaſts, to come and tread down the flowers? then are the Patrons of Toleration, friends to Religion.</p>

Then are they friends to Religion, who contend for this univerſal Toleration.</p>
               <p>If theſe be the Guardians of Religion, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not like to be long lived under their protection.

The <hi>Epheſians</hi> for their <hi>Diana,</hi> what extraordinarie zeal? when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that by <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching againſt gods made with hands, was like to overthrow their Religion; they cryed for the ſpace of two <note place="margin">

If you will be zealous for the Houſe of God, God will be zealous for your houſes, <hi>vid.</hi> 2 Sam. 6. 10, 11. <hi>Obed Edom,</hi> he had a zeal for the Ark, when others were afraid of it, God bleſſes him, <hi>vid.

                  <hi>Motive</hi> 7. Its one of the beſt wayes, to take off, and abate the heat of enemies, againſt the Houſe of God. The colder you are, the more hot will they be; and the more zealous you are, the more cold will they be in promoting their deſignes.</p>
               <p>2. Rules for zeal.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Your Zeal muſt be univerſal, and that</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of things, you muſt be zealous for everie part of Gods Houſe; for all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie part of Truth, againſt all and everie kind of corruption in Worſhip: ſome are zealous againſt Schiſme and Hereſie; but they have no great Zeal againſt ſuperſtition, and humane inventions; others have a Zeal againſt Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, but they have not againſt Hereſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is not right heat, <hi>vid. Pſal.</hi> 119. 104. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> his Zeal was againſt everie Corruption, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 23. 4. <hi>ad</hi> 20. God commands him, verſ. 25. Such was the Zeal of Chriſt alſo. He leaves nothing behinde, Sacraments, Preaching, Prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of perſons, he that hath a right zeal for Truth, will oppoſe all; is contrarie to Truth, in one perſon, as well as in another; in great, as well as in ſmall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a Friend, as well as in an Enemie. Zeal is like God in this, there is no reſpect of perſons with it. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever defiles the Houſe of God, let his Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Power, be what it will, Zeal will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him. Zeal doth not hate error in a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and love it in another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt will
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170411:127"/>
throw down the Tables of the Money-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, whoſoever they be that fit there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In reſpect of times. True Zeal for <hi>Gods</hi> Houſe, hath no winter, it burns in one Age, as well as in another. Manie men were verie zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous againſt corruption in Worſhip and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in the raign of Prelacie, which now are cold againſt the ſame, or worſe corruptions in the raign of Hereſie. Theſe were never truly zealous for Gods Houſe. Corruption of Truth and Worſhip, is as bad one year as another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) Zeal muſt be joyned with prudence and knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. God hath given to man an underſtanding, as well as affection. Zeal without Diſcretion, is raſhneſs, like mettle in a blinde Horſe, or a ſharp edged Sword, in a mad mans hand. Thoſe 4. Beaſts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 8. which repreſent the Churches of the Goſpel, they had 6. Wings, and they were full of Eyes: a Chriſtian muſt have Eyes, as well as Wings, Knowledge as well as Zeal. <hi>Zeal</hi> with Knowledge, ſaith one, is like an <hi>Unicorns</hi> Horn, in the hand of an Artiſt, verie precious; but Zeal without Knowledge, is as the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns</hi> Horn, in the Beaſts Head, verie dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Zeal without Knowledge, is like <hi>Pega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> without a Bridle, or like an Offering, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Eye, which <hi>God</hi> accepts not. <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 22. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 8. Its like <hi>Phaeton</hi> in his Fathers Chariot, may burn himſelf, and the World too.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:170411:127"/>
(3) Zeal for Gods Houſe, muſt be confined within the Compaſſe of our Calling. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in his place, the Magiſtrate in his, the private perſon in his place. 'Tis a good gloſſe which <hi>Calvin</hi> hath on this Text. All muſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chriſt, all muſt as much as in them lyeth, preſerve the Temple of God from defilement; yet everie man muſt take heed, that he go not beyond his bounds. <hi>Non omnibus protinus licet flagellum arripere, ut vitia manu corrigamus, ne<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> enim eadem nobis potest as data est, nec idem injunctum munus.</hi> Zeal out of its place, is like fire in the Thatch. Private Chriſtians, they muſt expreſs their zeal by Prayer, Teares, Diſpute, complaining to the Church, to the Magiſtrates, where they are, if they be ſuch as care for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. He that ſhould, being a private perſon, do as <hi>Phinehas</hi> did, and pretend zeal, would be a murtherer; or as Chriſt here did, would be ſeditious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4) Our zeal for Gods Houſe, muſt be for the glorie of God; not either to get our ſelves a name, or to oppoſe men, or to pleaſe others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but meerly diſcharge of duty, reſpect to Gods Honour. This was the ground of our Saviours zeal, make not <hi>my Fathers Houſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jehu</hi> loſt all his zeal, for want of a right end, <hi>vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 10. He did verie much, and he calls it zeal for God, verſ. 16. but the truth is, it was meerly for his own houſe; and therefore <hi>God</hi> threatens, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 4. to avenge the blood of <hi>Jezreel,</hi> upon the Houſe of <hi>Jehu,</hi> &amp;c. look well to this.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:170411:128"/>
(5) It muſt be put out againſt private cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in your own caſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Meanes to get zeal for <hi>Gods</hi> Houſe.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Conſider often the worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of <hi>Gods</hi> Houſe, Truth, Worſhip, they are glorious things, beauties of holineſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. the glorie of <hi>God:</hi> the glorie is departed from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. latter end: the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of <hi>God</hi> with men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="3">(3) Be much in the Company of zealous perſons, he that kiſſeth the lips of the Servants of <hi>God,</hi> who are zealous, will get heat from them.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Take heed of too much carnal policie. This will make you but cold and dead, for the Worſhip of <hi>God.</hi> He whoſe zeal is extreme hot, for outward things will be extreme cold, at leaſt luke-warm, for the Worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> a little Earth caſt on a hot fire, puts it out.</p>

As he teſtified his love to ſouls, by his Incarnation, and taking this Office upon him, ſo the ſame love to the Salvation of men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited him to diligence in performing it.</p>

work: he knew the light of his perſonal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, was to ſhine but a few moneths in the World, therefore he would loſe no opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet a little while, and the light ſhineth, with you, ſaith our Saviour to the Jewes, <note place="margin">

               <p>4. Reaſ. <hi>It was from the reſpect he had to his Fathers glory.</hi> His work was, to bring ſouls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubjection to his Fathers Commands, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Father, by revealing his will unto men. This lay ſo cloſe upon his ſoul, that he <note place="margin">

And therefore, we read, that the Apoſtles after his Aſcenſion, remembring, no doubt, as well the Example, as the Command of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, were very diligent in the ſame work. Its recorded of them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 4.

               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) This lets us ſee the neceſſity lying upon all the ſons of men, to have ſome particular lawfull calling; Chriſt himſelf was laborious in his calling, therefore he had a particular calling, and that not onely in the time of his publick life, but alſo in the time of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life. Is not this the <hi>Carpenter, the Son of Mary?</hi> Mark. 6. 3. They indeed ſpake it by way of ſcorne and deriſion, that a Perſon of ſo meane education as Chriſt was in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, ſhould pretend himſelf to be the Meſſiah, <hi>vid. Math.</hi> 13. 55, 56. but the ſtory ſhews clearly that our Lord, before he entred upon the publick miniſtry, did employ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that Calling. And ſo the Ancients have underſtood that place. <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho</hi> againſt the Jewes, <hi>teſtatur Chriſtum juga &amp; aratra fabricaviſſe.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chemnit. Harm. in Mar.</hi> 6. 3</note> And <hi>Baſil</hi> in his Book, <hi>de vita ſolit.</hi> Cap. 5. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that Chriſt did <hi>aſſiduo corporalium laborum exercitio victum ſibi neceſſarium unà cum parentibus pauperibus compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> And the Apoſtle would have all Chriſtians to have ſome lawful particular Calling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 20. When God had created <hi>Adam,</hi> he put him into a particular Calling, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 15. The Lord took the man, and put him <hi>into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Eden, to dreſſe and to keep it.</hi> There ſhould have been labour, if ſin had never entred into the World. Its true, that labour would have been without toylſome painfulneſs, wearineſs, with which it is accompanied ſince the fall; but
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170411:133"/>
Man ſhould not have lived idly, though he had not fallen from his innocency. We read alſo, that all the Patriarchs had particular Callings. <hi>Noah</hi> was an <hi>Husbandman,</hi> Gen. 10. 20. <hi>Abel</hi> was a <hi>Keeper of ſheep,</hi> Gen. 4. 2. The Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> were Shepherds, and <hi>keepers of Cattle,</hi> Gen. 46. 34. All the Apoſtles, before they were called to the work of the Miniſtrie, had their particular vocation. Men who live without a Calling, are uſeleſs and unprofitable burdens to the Common-wealth, and places where they live. They are well compared to ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the Body, which are very pernicious and deſtructive to the well being of the Body. They are like <hi>wandring Starres,</hi> which have no certain ſtation. Nay, thoſe who have no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Calling, they will certainly make ſin their Trade, either theeving, or elſe vain and ſinful pleaſures and delights, as many do, or <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 11.</note> buſie-bodies. He is ready for any work, which the Devil and his own wicked heart can put into his hands.</p>
               <p>Such cannot pray over that Petition, Give us this day <hi>our</hi> daily bread: he eats that which is none of his own. All Divines make it a breach of the eighth Command (Thou ſhalt not ſteal) for any man to live without ſome lawful par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular vocation. The holy Servants of God, brought up their Children in ſome Calling or other. <hi>Adam,</hi> who had a whole World to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath to his Children, did diſpoſe of them to ſeveral Callings, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel.</hi>

(2) <hi>This is a good plea for frequent preaching.</hi> Some think one Sermon, or at leaſt a very few Sermons, are ſufficient to ſerve a mans turn all his life, and that often preaching, is but a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſuperfluous thing. Certainly, Jeſus Chriſt would not have been ſo diligent in a work, which had been unneceſſarie, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacaneous. Conſider but theſe particulars, to ſhew the neceſſitie of it, beſides Chriſts Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) We have the Command of God for it, <hi>Preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 2. Reprove, rebuke, exhort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>There's very great need of frequent preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> for,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) There are many Truths which are to be made known unto the People of God. The whole Counſel of God is to be publiſhed: the Scriptures are a large and fruitful Field, they cannot preſently be gone over; the Body of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, is very large; many, and many ſteps, muſt be taken before all the pathes, and parts of it, can be unfolded. There's a great deal of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this Cabinet, which cannot be ſhewed at once, many duties to be performed, many ſins which are to be avoided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many Caſes of Conſcience to be anſwered, many ſcruples to be reſolved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it were poſſible, that a Miniſter could live 100. yeares, twice told, and preach without interruption, yet there would be a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170411:134"/>
which would have been neceſſary to have been declared, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) The Sons of men, even the very beſt are ſubject to forget many things, which have been committed to them: man's memory is very lax and brittle, ſince the coming of ſin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world; the ſame things had need be preached over and over againe, precept upon precept, duty upon duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> frequent preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a neceſſary help for a looſe memory, <hi>vid. Phil.</hi> 3. 1. Which of you beare in mind a Sermon of two or three yeares ſtanding?</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>The hearts of men are ſoon gone out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, even, after the moſt kindly working upon in a Sermon,</hi> partly from that corruption which workes within, and partly from Satan which tempteth without; heats are ſoon cooled, impreſſions wrought with much painfulneſſe are ſoon worne out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> vid. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. they were preſently warped aſide, even after <hi>Pauls</hi> miniſtrie, vid. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 4. It was the ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of one of the Ancients, and it is that which all have cauſe to lament, That a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter can never find his work as he leaves it. Let a Carpenter hew his timber, let a Maſon poliſh his ſtones, let a Painter make his draught <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if they come not a year after, they find it as they leave it: but the work of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is undone from Sabbath to Sabbath; the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned heart, growes hard againe, the tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience growes ſtupid, <hi>&amp;c. Moſes</hi> left the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> pretty orderly, when he went up into the Mount of God, but they had ſoon

corrupted themſelves, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 7. 8. ſo we find it in all our hearts by ſad experience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Iron which was glowing hot, is key cold againe, the affections which were extended, they are contracted againe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Satan and a wicked heart, even unravell all which is done in one Sermon before another Sermon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is with us in this caſe, as it is with little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, waſh them never ſo clean, if the Mother leave them an hour or two, they have as much need of waſhing as before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Satan never ceaſeth tempting; <hi>ergo,</hi> neceſſary to preach fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. Many Miniſters will not preach too often, becauſe of ſtate; whereas indeed the Pulpit is the moſt honourable place for a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. <hi>Cum venerit Chriſtus, inveniat me praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantem,</hi> was the good wiſh of <hi>Biſhop Jewell;</hi> others think often preaching, is the way to caſt contempt upon preaching, whereas 'tis indeed the vvay to make it more glorious to a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all heart; the viſion is made more lovelie by frequent beholding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tis true, all mens parts of body and mind are not alike.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) <hi>The lives of Miniſters are very ſhort,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 14. The Fathers are dead, and the Prophets are dead.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) <hi>There are ſome newly admitted and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up</hi> in the Church daily, which muſt not be neglected, <hi>ergo.</hi> And if you would have Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to be frequent in preaching, you muſt incourage them by being frequent in hearing; thin auditories occaſion ſeldome preaching. Its ſaid here in this place, our Saviour taught

dailie in the Temple, and its ſaid in the very next verſe, the people were verie attentive to heare him, <gap reason="foreign">

Thick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditories ſhould not be the marke a Miniſter ſhould aime at, where two or three are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, there God is as well as in a crowd; the converſion of one ſoul, is vvorth all a mans paines: but forvvardneſs to heare is a great motive. If you therefore vvould have your Miniſters to do as Chriſt did, you muſt for your parts imitate this people, and be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to hear them.</p>
               <p>2. Uſe. <hi>Exhortation to that of the Apoſtles,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 6. let all Chriſtians anſvver Chriſts coppie in this buſineſſe, make the vvork of your calling, your daily buſineſs, as your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did. In the proſecution of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, I ſhall handle theſe three things, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) I ſhall lay down ſome Rules from the right underſtanding of this diligence in our particular callings. And then</p>
               <p n="2">(2) I ſhall give ſome motives to preſs dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. And</p>
               <p n="3">(3) I ſhall add ſome helpes or directions.</p>
               <p>1. Rule. <hi>That diligence in our particular calling doth not deny or forbid the daily practiſing of ſuch things as doe belong to our generall call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as praying, reading the Scriptures, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Lectures when vve may have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity on the vveek daies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are ſome who either out of a profane or ignorant ſpirit, think themſelves ſo tied up to follow their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170411:136"/>
callings, that they muſt not in any time of the ſix daies of the week, intermeddle with any religious work, but ſpend it vvhollie about their vvorldlie buſineſs. I would have ſuch to conſider that,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) The ſame God which hath commanded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in your particular calling has alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded daily praier, &amp; reading the Scriptures, and other duties of vvorſhip. The Jews who vvere commanded to labour ſix daies, yet were commanded to offer the morning and evening ſacrifice daily, vid. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 38, 39. and <hi>Num.</hi> 28. 3. They had their morning ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vvhen they entred upon their vvork, and they had their evening ſacrifice when they ended their work. They divided the daie into three parts, the firſt, <hi>ad tephilla, orationem,</hi> to prayer, the ſecond <hi>ad torah, legem,</hi> for the reading of the Law: the third, <hi>ad malacha, opus,</hi> for the vvorks of their lavvfull calling<hi>:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Weemſe,</hi> mor. Law <hi>p.</hi> 223.</note> they vvere daies appointed for vvork, yet they gave God his part of them every day. And vve knovv that all governours of families are enjoined, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8. to ſpeak morning and evening at leaſt, of the ſtatutes of God to their Children and Servants. God hath reſerved to himſelf, vvho is the Lord of all time, part of our time every daie, and the particular calling muſt give way to the general.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Jeſus Chriſt commended <hi>Mary,</hi> for ſetting by her particular calling, to wait upon an occaſion and opportunity offered to hear a Sermon, vid. <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> Chriſt juſtifieth
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170411:136"/>
                  <hi>Mary</hi> for that holy neglect of her particular calling, and reprooves <hi>Martha</hi> for her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and for her own too much worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Theſe exerciſes of Gods worſhip, do not hinder, but further the works of the particular calling. Its the way to draw down a bleſſing from heaven upon the workes of our hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whet is no Let. The travellor loſeth nothing by baiting his horſe, and refreſhing himſelf. Prayer is like <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Laban,</hi> it brings Gods bleſſing upon what we do, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 27. 30. Onely this; diligence in our particular calling requires us not to be quite taken off from it, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of praying, hearing, reading, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Every one that is fit for labour, muſt labour as wel as pray; the generall calling muſt not eate up the particular, nor the particular the generall<hi>:</hi> As he ſins, who upon pretence of diligence in his calling, will neither pray, nor read, nor heare a Sermon on the week daie; So doth he offend who being fit for labour, doth upon pretence of hearing, praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all the week long, neglect his particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>2. Rule. <hi>This diligence doth not exempt us from ſetting daies apart, for publick humiliation, and publick thankſgivings, lawfully commanded upon lawfull occaſions;</hi> Theſe are enjoyned by God to his people, as well as labour, <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> proclaimed a faſt in a time of trouble, and the people are commended for their ready at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170411:137"/>
upon that ſervice, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 20. 3. 4. So <hi>Ezra,</hi> 8. 23. and <hi>Joel,</hi> 1. 14. Now in ſuch times, upon ſuch occaſions, all bodily labours are to be laid aſide, and bodily delights, and it is to be ſpent as a holy Sabbath, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58. 3. they are reproved for exacting their labours, and finding their pleaſure. And ſo for publick Thankſgivings, when the Church of God hath received ſome notable mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20 26.</note> ſo for private faſtings and thankſgivings, we are enjoyned in all ſuch caſes, to ſet apart our particular callings; that we may give our ſelves to the worſhip of the Lord, vid. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>3. Rule. <hi>Diligence in our particular calling, doth not take us off from doing works of mercy,</hi> &amp;c. We may leave, yea we muſt leave our particular callings, if need be, to attend upon the ſick, to quench houſes on fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The works of our generall calling on the Sabbath day, may, yea muſt be left upon any ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. I will have mercy and not ſacrifice, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 6. By this Scripture our Saviour war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted, and juſtified his Diſciples plucking of the eares of Corne, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 7. though it was done upon the Sabbath day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> much more muſt the works of our particular calling give way, to ſuch acts. <hi>Paul</hi> leaves preaching and the people hearing, to take up <hi>Eutychus</hi> fallen down from a window, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:170411:137"/>
4. Rule. <hi>Diligence in our particular calling doth not forbid the uſe of naturall reſt, or of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full recreation, both to our ſelves and to thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our charge.</hi> God would not have the very beaſts overburdened, or overwrought; a good man ſheweth mercy to his beaſt, <hi>Pro.</hi> 12. 10. much leſſe would he have a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture overtoyled beyond his ſtrength. There muſt be a time for ſleep, as well as a time for labour. Man goeth forth to his work untill the evening, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104, 23. To deny either our ſelves, or others, that reſt which God hath afforded unto all living Creatures, is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but ſinfull worldlineſſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive labour, and indeed oppreſſion. And ſo for Recreation, diligence doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the uſe of that. There is a time for every purpoſe under Heaven, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. <hi>init.</hi> A time for work, and a time for relaxation. Onely in our recreations, we muſt obſerve theſe things;</p>
               <p n="1">(1) It muſt not be uſed, but when the body or mind are by wearineſſe made unfit to wait upon the particular calling, without hurt or prejudice.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) It muſt be of ſuch things as are not ſcandalous, but lawfull: now for this, that Rule of the Apoſtle is well to be conſidered and carefully practiſed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8. Whatſoever things are true, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) It muſt onely be ſo much and ſo long, as till the body and mind be repaired, the ſpirits and ſtrength recruited, and ſo made fit
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170411:138"/>
for the following of the particular employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which God hath placed us, the end of recreation is to fit for labour in our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpeciall vocation. And when the body and mind are fitted for employment then the end of recreation is accompliſhed; and it is a ſin to uſe it any longer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe Rules being premiſed, I ſhall now proceed to give ſome Motives, to ſtir us up to be like Chriſt in diligence. And they are.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Motive. From the miſchiefe of idleneſs. And that,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) In regard of the ſinfullneſſe of it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) In regard of the evill effects of it.</p>
               <p>(1) Idleneſſe is a great ſin in it ſelf. It is a ſin,</p>
               <p>(1) Againſt the Law of Creation. God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated man to labour: before he had ſinned, he was put into the Garden, to dreſſe it, and to keep it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 15. and after ſin, this Law was put upon him; In the ſweat of thy face, thou ſhalt eat thy bread all the dayes of thy life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. Sweating labour is a fruit of ſin; but labour was impoſed upon man, though he had not ſinned. Now the idle perſon doth violate this Law of Creation, and doth by idleneſs caſt off the Authority of his Creator, who made him for labour. God hath given to man hands, which are the Inſtruments of working, and a head furniſhed with underſtanding, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and finde out employment for the hands: Now the idle perſon doth fruſtrate one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170411:138"/>
end of God, in beſtowing ſuch apt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of work upon him. And its no ſmall ſin for a man to pervert the end of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Idleneſs is a ſin againſt the Law of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Juſtice requires, that a man ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and live on that which is his own. Now the idle perſon, like lice and vermine, lives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other mens ſweat; and ſo, ſins againſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Our Saviour hath commanded us to pray that God would give us <hi>our daily bread.</hi> That bread which is not gotten by labour, either of body or minde, is not our bread, but anothers: the idle perſon enters into other mens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, whereas juſtice requires, that every man ſhould eat the labour of his own hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128. 2.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Its a ſin againſt the Law of Charity. Charity requires, that every man ſhould be uſeful to that ſociety, whereof he is a member. And there is no Calling, that is lawful, ſo meane, but by diligence in it, a perſon may be ſerviceable to mankind. Now, the idle perſon breaks this Law, he is <hi>telluris inutile pondus;</hi> and like a dead member, in the natural body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no good, but much prejudice to the whole body. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> calls idle perſons, <hi>Creaturas Domini ſuperfluas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) Idleneſs hath evil effects.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Poenal effects.</p>
               <p>1. Idleneſs is an inlet to many other ſins. It is indeed, <hi>pulvinar Diaboli,</hi> the Devils
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170411:139"/>
Cuſhion, on which he ſits, and the Devils An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, on which he frames very many ſins. Toads and Serpents breed in ſtanding waters, ſo in the idle perſon.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Its the door of luſt, and uncleanneſs of body. <hi>Quaeritur Aegiſtus quare ſit factus Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: In promptu cauſa eſt, Deſidioſus erat.</hi> The Scripture makes this to be the cauſe of <hi>Davids</hi> Adulterie with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> 2 Sam. 11. 2. <hi>David</hi> was out of employment, he was ſloathfully lying upon his bed, in the day time, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his roof, when he ſhould have been employed about the matters of his Kingdom; and now Satan takes this opportunitie, and excites luſt in his ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Its the way to theft, and purloyning; your idle perſon, is within a few ſteps of this ſin, if he have but a temptation, and a fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. You know, how it was with that idle Steward, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 3, 4, 5. He could not dig, he had that foul Diſeaſe of idleneſs upon him, and therefore could not dig; and he that cannot dig, will ſteal and cheat, and defraud. He that will not work, will not ſtick to ſet down 100. for 50. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle hints this alſo, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 28. Let him that ſtole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but let him work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And indeed, idleneſs is a degree of Theevery, in its own Nature; it breaks that Commandment, Thou ſhalt not ſteal.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) It brings in tatlings and tale-bearings, which is a great ſin. The Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 11. puts theſe two together, as the Tree and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170411:139"/>

                  </gap> He that is idle in his Calling, or lives without a Calling, he will go up and down as a buſie-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, either to hear newes, or to tell newes. He that is idle, when he ſhould work, will be ſure to be buſie, where he ſhould not meddle. <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 13.</note> And,</p>
               <p n="4">(4) To wrap many things together, the idle perſon is as tinder, to take any ſpark of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Devil, or evil Company, the inſtruments of the Devil, ſhall let fall upon him: he ſits at Satans receit of Cuſtom, ready to do the worſt work Satan ſhall put into his hands. Drunkenneſs or gaming, or riot, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind of wickedneſs, nothing comes amiſſe to his hands.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) It brings poenal evils, as well as ſinful, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) It ingenders Diſeaſes, both of body and minde; idleneſs weakens the endowments of Nature, and deſtroyes the gifts of the minde, which God and Nature hath beſtowed. Its the ruſt and canker, both of gifts and graces; it worm-eats, marres, and, in time, utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes all a mans excellencies, and eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, that <hi>Labour brings ſtrength to the body, and vigour to the minde.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e is the way to increaſe. Many a man by idleneſs, hath loſt very excellent parts, which might have been improved for <hi>Gods</hi> honour, and mans benefit.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) It brings poverty; idleneſs ſhall cloath a man with rags, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 21. <hi>vid. Prov.</hi> 6. 9, 10,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170411:140"/>
11. The diligent hand maketh rich, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 10. And that property which is the fruit of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, findes no pitty with <hi>God,</hi> nor compaſſion with men; but ſcorn and deriſion from both.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Its a ſin which <hi>God</hi> puniſheth in this life; ſometimes with deſtruction. It was one ſin which brought ruine upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> Ezech. 16. 49. The idle perſon may fear the ſame hand of <hi>God</hi> upon him. And then,</p>
               <p n="4">(4) It brings condemnation at laſt, without repentance. Take the unprofitable ſervant, and caſt him into utter darkneſs, where is weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 30. Not only <hi>ſervum flagitioſum,</hi> but <hi>ſervum inutilem.</hi> The reward of eternal life, is given only to the Labourers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 8. Call the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, and give them their hire, beginning at the laſt, even unto the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>Motive.</hi> From the excellency of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſweeteneth all the comforts of life: the ſleep of the labouring man is ſweet to him, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 12. The meat and drink, and ſleep of the loyterer, cannot be ſweet to him, becauſe he doth not enjoy them in the way of holineſs; they are not fruits of honeſt Labour, but fruits of idleneſs, <hi>vid.</hi> Prov. 12. 27.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) It doth not only ſweeten, but its one way to ſanctifie all the Comforts of life; he may pray to God, for a bleſſing on what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes; whereas the idle perſon, can have no
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170411:140"/>
confidence to pray for Gods bleſſing upon his enjoyments: the diligent man, may look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what he gets by labour, not only as a fruit of Gods bounty, but as a reward of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto the Commandment of God, which hath enjoyned labour and travel unto the ſons of men. And then,</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Diligence uſed in a mans Calling, will exceedingly comfort and keep up his ſpirit, if the providence of God croſſe him, and bring troubles upon him.</p>
               <p>And then (4) Diligence keeps a perſon out of many ſnares and temptations. Satan uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſets upon a man, when he is doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To give ſome Helps to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be often obſerving ſuch as are diligent; look upon all the commendations given in Scripture, to perſons for their diligence, <hi>vid. Prov.</hi> 30. 10, 11, 12, 27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All the Patriarchs, all the Apoſtles, all the Prophets, were men of diligence in their Calling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) Conſider the very brute Creatures, they are emblems of diligence. The <hi>Ant,</hi> the <hi>Bee,</hi> how diligent are they in their labours? <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 6. And if you look upon the inanimate Creatures, how diligent are they? The Sun, Moon, Stars, they are alwayes in their travel, doing the work of their places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) Conſider, how God hath honoured diligence. <hi>Eliſha</hi> was called to be a Prophet, when he was at his labour, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 19, 19. Chriſt called <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> to be
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170411:141"/>
Diſciples, when they were at their labour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 18. And ſo <hi>James,</hi> the Son of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> his Brother, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 21. They were mending their Nets. And <hi>Matthew</hi> was called, when he was following his work, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 9. And the firſt tidings of the birth of Chriſt, were publiſhed to the diligent Shepherds, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 8, 9.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Study well the preciouſneſs of time and ſtrength. The idle perſon hath not a true eſteem of the worth of time, elſe he would not ſpend it idly. Time paſſeth, ſtrength wears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, old age and ſickneſs are a comming, when you muſt neceſſarily ceaſe from labouring: the ſhip of the body, muſt ſhortly come to be laid up in the Harbour, when it cannot fail.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) Conſider, that others are intereſted in your labours, as well as your ſelves. If you be ſervants, you owe both your parts, and labour unto them who have employed you: the idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſervants, is robberie to their Maſters, if you be Maſters, your Family and Relations, which you are bound to provide for; if you will not be worſe then Infidels, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. may challenge your diligence; and if you have no ſuch, yet the Common-wealth and Societie of Man-kind, are much prejudiced by your ſtanding ſtill.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) He that is negligent in his particular Calling, will never be diligent in his general: he that is negligent in his Shop, will be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Working ſix dayes, and the obſerving of the Sabbath, are joyned together,

               <p>IN this Chapter, there are five principal paſſages, which are the five parts of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>(1) The Parable of the Seed, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and expounded, from Verſ. 1. ad 21.</p>
               <p>(2) An Exhortation to that neceſſarie, and profitable Duty, of communicating unto one
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170411:143"/>
another, of that light of ſpiritual knowledge, and other gifts received from God, verſ. 21. ad 26.</p>
               <p>And (3) The Doctrine of the working of the Word, preached upon the hearts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men, illuſtrated by the manner of the growth of Seed, ſowen by the hand of the Husband-man, verſ. 26. ad 30.</p>
               <p>(4) The growth and increaſe of the Goſpel, ſet out by the Parable of Muſtard-ſeed, verſ. 30. ad 35.</p>
               <p>(5) The miraculous Act of Chriſt, in the ſuddain ſwelling of the Tempeſt, v. 35. <hi>ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words which I have read, hold out a verie excellent Act of Chriſt, towards his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in reference to this Sermon: when he was alone, he expounded all things to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which words, we have two things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Chriſts Action, He expounded <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, He untyed all knots, made all things plain to his Diſciples.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The Circumſtance of time and place, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when they were in private. That which it teacheth us, is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That the Lord Jeſus, in the dayes of his fleſh, was very careful, in teaching and instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe which were under his charge in the things of God.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt was a Maſter of a Family, though he had no where to lay his
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170411:143"/>
head; yet he had Servants, the Diſciples were his Servants; and, as he did in all other reſpects, carrie himſelf as a faithful Maſter to them, ſo was he not negligent in teaching them the things of God. We ſhall finde our Saviour, verie careful of them in this reſpect: he taught them to pray, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 2. And upon everie occaſion, he was dropping Religious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Inſtruction upon their ſouls: he did not only preach publiquely to them, as he did to others; but in ſecret alſo, and in private: his uſe was, to repeat what he had preached in the publique Aſſemblie, with Explanation, as need required: when he had reproved the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and ceremonial waſhings, uſed by the Phariſees before meales, and had uttered an obſcure paſſage, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 11. we finde, that verſ. 16, 17. He interprets that Doctrine in private to his Diſciples, and makes them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the meaning of it more perfectly, Do ye not know, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That was in private, <hi>vid. Mar.</hi> 7. 17, 18. So <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 25, 26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the two Diſciples. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 3, 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 16.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>The Diſciples were called to be Miniſters of the Goſpel.</hi> Therefore it was neceſſarie, they ſhould be inſtructed. <hi>Vid. Acts</hi> 1. 8. Ye ſhall be witneſſes unto me, both in <hi>Judea,</hi> and in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in all <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> and

unto the uttermoſt part of the Earth, both that they might have fulneſs of knowledge, and might learn willingly, to anſwer ſcruples pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, to any that ſhould repair to them, as well as preach in publick; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 20.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>It, was out of ſenſe and compaſſion to their ignorance.</hi> Our Saviour knew how blind the heart of man is by Nature, to receive the things of God; and he had often had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Diſciples weakneſſes in many things: this made him ſo careful, to uſe all diligence in inſtructing them; and the rather alſo, that he might convince them of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) To teach all Maſters and Governours, what their dutie is, towards ſuch as are under their charge, and that they might by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, be helped forward to do their Duty. <hi>Omnis Chriſti actio, nostra inſtructio,</hi> Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended mans information by all he did.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſider Gods strict command,</hi> vid. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7. The Law of God is indiſpenſable; every Iſraelite of God is abſolutely bound to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance <note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider the practiſe of the Servants of God whoſe names are renowned, and whoſe memories are precious in the book of God.</hi> I will begin with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. 19. <hi>David, Pro.</hi> 4. 4. and ſo <hi>Bathſheba, Pro.</hi> 31. 1. And it is not to be queſtioned, but he alſo taught his Servants, as well as his Children. The Parents of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> they taught him the Scriptures of a Child, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. Theſe are rare examples, and <hi>Joſhuah</hi> 24. 15. he could never have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for himſelf and houſhould, had he not been an inſtructor of his houſhould.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Conſider <hi>the benefit of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) Your Servants will never do your work faithfully, if they <hi>be not inſtructed how to do Gods work.</hi> Thoſe are likely to have the beſt ſervice from ſuch as are under the charge, who are moſt diligent to teach them their trade of Godlineſſe. Conſcience is the ſureſt and ſafeſt obligation in all the world; and your ſervants will without doubt be faithfull to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170411:145"/>
you, if you can perſwade them to do your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>For your Children, 'tis the way to preſerve and keep up the honour of your family.</hi> There is a naturall deſire in every man, that his family may be renowned when he is laid in the duſt. Tis Religion and Piety which builds up and keeps up the renown of Families. Riches may be imbezeld, and titles of honour may die, but godlinſſe and pietie can never die. <hi>Iſaacs</hi> pietie kept up the credit of <hi>Abrahams</hi> familie when he was in the duſt. <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was rich, but he was wicked, <hi>Jacob</hi> preſerved the memory of <hi>Iſaac</hi> by his piety, <hi>Eſau</hi> had wealth, but his wickedneſſe was a blot, both to himſelf and his Fathers houſe. Its juſt that God ſhould curſe that man in his poſterity, in his waies of Religion, and its righteous with God that ſuch Servants ſhould become ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to their Maſters as have not been taught by them the knowledge of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>By informing of them which are under your charge, you will informe your own ſouls.</hi> He that whets the word of God upon his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Children, will with that whetting ſet a ſharper edge upon his own affections. By repeating a Sermon to others, you will ſtrengthen your own memories, and warme your own hearts. As iron ſharpens iron, ſo the heart of a man, his friend, <hi>Pro.</hi> 27. 17.</p>

(4) <hi>You may benefit the Church of God for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny generations.</hi> A good man would have the Church of God to flouriſh not onely while he lives, but after his deceaſe, he would have generations to come, to know and bleſſe the Lord. This is the waie to propagate Religion after thine own deceaſe. Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are likely to ſurvive Maſters and Parents. And if they be not inſtructed and taught in their youth, the next generation may for ought you know, be atheiſticall and paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.

               <p n="5">(5) <hi>Conſider the many preſent Errours that are ſprung up amongſt us.</hi> The firmament of our Church is filled, and even darkened with the thick black ſmoak of profane, and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroying opinions. And every one of your Children and Servants have a biaſſe upon their hearts which draweth them violently this waie; they may bring the plague of Errors and Hereſie into your families, they may bring home the leaven of the Phariſes, and ſadduces into your houſes.

               <p n="2">(2) <hi>Ignorance of God is damnable,</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, It is <hi>life eternall to know God and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent,</hi> Joh. 17. 3. And therefore it muſt needs be eternall death, to be ignorant of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie when ſufficient means for this knowledg, is and may be enjoyed. It is the complaint of God, that his people were deſtroied for want of knowledge, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 6. not onely with temporall, but eternall deſtruction. And if any ſoul periſh through ignorance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your roofe, through your default, his ſoul will be required at your hands. What God ſaith to the Watchman concerning his charge, is as applicable to every governour of a family in his ſphere. If you give not the wicked man warning, he ſhall die, but his blood will

I require at thy hands, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. 8. Every Maſter of a family is as well and as truly made a Watchman of God, to do all domeſticall duties within his ſphere (where of this is one) as the Miniſter is over the Congregation, and muſt as wel be accountable to God for the ſouls under his charge. And therfore God in the 4th. Commandement, puts the care and inſpection of all within the family, upon the governours, Thou &amp; thy Son, &amp; thy Daughter, &amp; thy man-Servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thou mightſt perhaps, be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of ſaving thy Child or Servant from Hell, wert thou carefull of doing thy dutie.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) <hi>Conſider the juſtice and equity of this duty.</hi> That you ſhouldſt inſtruct thoſe who are thy Children by Nature, is but Equitie, in as much as the blindneſs and ignorance which is in them, is from thee conveid, as the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſtrumentall cauſe. They drew their blindneſs from thy loines, thou didſt beget and bring them forth in thine own ſinfull Image, whereof this ignorance is a part, and therefore thou art bound by all rules of juſtice to do what thou canſt to make reſtitution. And for adopted Children and Servants, by contract committed to thy care by friends or guardians, the like obligation lieth upon thee in point of juſtice, to teach them the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Moſt Holie, according to thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; for though expreſly this clauſe be not put into the engagement, yet virtuallie and implicitly it is intended: the parent or friends
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170411:147"/>
commit their Children into thy hands, upon ſuch termes that the ſoul ſhould be looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as well as the bodie; and if They do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it, yet Theologically, by vertue of thy place, as a Maſter, God expects it from thee; and thou art not onely uncharitable, but unjuſt alſo, if thou neglect this part of the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It will not be enough to ſay, I have inſtructed them in all the parts of the myſterie I profeſs, I have made them skilfull in their Art, but if they be uninſtructed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, the leaſt halfe of the Covenant is made good, &amp; God will both judge &amp; puniſh thee for a fraudulent and unfaithfull man that haſt betrayed thy truſt.</p>
               <p>2ly. Directions. Take theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>Thou muſt be carefull to furniſh thy ſelf with a competency of knowledge and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Religion.</hi> To govern a ſmall familie, requires no ſmall knowledge. God would have a Maſter of a familie to be able to inſtruct both Wife and Children. Dwell with thy Wife as a man of knowledge, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. and the woman is commanded not to ſpeak in the Church; but, if ſhe want, to ask her husband at home, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 35. If the Wife muſt aske, the Husband ſhould be able to reſolve neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie queſtions. I doubt the want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in governours takes them off from this duty; indeed renders them uncapable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170411:147"/>
it. Therefore by ſtudying the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by reading good Catechiſms, and other good books, and by Praier get ſound knowledge.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>Pray for a good Conſcience, and keep a good Conſcience.</hi> As a good conſcience will keep men cloſe to God in other Duties, ſo will it do in this, and truely though a man have never ſuch plenty of knowledge, yet if he want Conſcience, the work will fall.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>Get large bowels of affections to God, to the knowledge of God, and the Souls of ſuch as God hath given thee inſpection over.</hi> This will promote the work. He that loves God truly, will diſperſe the knowledge of God freely; and he who beares any affection to ſouls, will be willing to light his Candle, to ſet them in the waie to life and happineſſe. He that doth not teach his Child, I dare ſay hath not a true Fatherlie love, either to God or his Child: Love will ſeek the beſt wellfare of that which is beloved.</p>
               <p>3dly. The Objections are theſe.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Object.</hi> If I ſhould inſtruct thus my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and be ſo ſtrict, repeat Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhould be reproached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. No good man would reproach thee, no, they would love thee, &amp; honour thee: &amp; if <hi>Michal</hi> ſcoffe and reproach, 'tis no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 21, 22. 'Tis no honour, to be prayſed, no diſhonour to be reproached by a wicked man.</p>
               <p>2. Such reproach is the way to happineſs, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14. The Saints of God have glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reproaches for Chriſts ſake, they have worn them as a Crown.</p>
               <p>3. If thou art afraid of reproach, be afraid of Gods reproach. He will reproach thee, if thou neglect this duty; and that not only here, but hereafter, <hi>vid. Dan.</hi> 12. 2. If thou neglect this duty, for fear of the Worlds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; thou mayſt lie down at laſt with the Worlds honour, but thou wilt riſe again to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting ſhame.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Object.</hi> But my Servants, they will not ſubmit to inſtruction, they think their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are free, and that no ſuch thing ſhould be impoſed upon them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. And what if they ſhould pretend the like freedom of Conſcience, as they call it, for the not doing of thy work in thine employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wouldſt thou think it a ſufficient <hi>Salvo?</hi> and why wilt thou take it for a diſcharge from doing Gods work?</p>
               <p>2. I anſwered, they are not free by any Law of God; nay, they are bound: if <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt teach his Houſhold the way of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> ſurelie his Houſhold muſt ſubmit to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, elſe the Commandment is void. And

                  <hi>Joſhuah</hi> took it for granted, that his Houſe ſhould ſerve the Lord, together with himſelf, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 15. He ſhould not dwell in <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> Houſe, that would not ſerve <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> God, whatſoever they pretended. The Rod of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline ſhould teach ſuch other practices, if after admonition and conviction, they remain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Object.</hi> But they are catechiſed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the Miniſter, therefore its needleſs I ſhould meddle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The Miniſterial inſtruction, doth not excuſe Domeſtical inſtruction. Chriſt taught his Diſciples publickly as a Miniſter, and yet he neglected not private inſtruction alſo; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate inſtruction helps on the publick, and the publick the private.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> This is a Doctrine of ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for the godlie. Jeſus Chriſt hath a Familie on Earth ſtill, though he be in Heaven, and the Church is his Houſhold, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6. And its his Office, to teach and inſtruct now, as much as ever, when he was on Earth. And be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, you ignorant Chriſtians, that Chriſt your Maſter, will untie all knots, which you cannot untie your ſelves. <hi>Qui docet corda, Cathedram habet in Coelo.</hi> Carry your doubts to him freely.</p>
